  abstract = {Inflammation is a manifestation of a wide range of disorders which include; arthritis, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, physical injury and infection amongst many others. Common treatment modalities are usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, paracetamol, indomethacin and ibuprofen as well as corticosteroids such as prednisone. These however, may be associated with a host of side effects due to non-selectivity for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes involved in inflammation and those with selectivity may be highly priced. Thus, there is a continuing search for safe and effective antiinflammatory molecules from natural sources. Research has confirmed that iridoids exhibit promising anti-inflammatory activity which may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammation. Iridoids are secondary metabolites present in various plants, especially in species belonging to the Apocynaceae, Lamiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Verbenaceae families. Many of these ethnobotanicals have an illustrious history of traditional use alluding to their use to treat inflammation. Although iridoids exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities such as cardiovascular, hepatoprotection, hypoglycaemic, antimutagenic, antispasmodic, anti-tumour, antiviral, immunomodulation and purgative effects this review will acutely focus on their anti-inflammatory properties. The paper aims to present a summary for the most prominent iridoid-containing plants for which anti-inflammatory activity has been demonstrated in vitro and / or in vivo.},

The setting of heavy metal limits is appropriate for medicines and is appropriate for supplements when heavy metals are likely or certain to contaminate a given product. Setting reasonable health-based limits for some of these metals is challenging because of their ubiquity in the environment, limitations of current analytical procedures, and other factors.

The free phenolic extract of the soybean was obtained by extraction with 80\% acetone, while that of the bound phenolic extract was done by extracting the alkaline and acid hydrolyzed residue with ethyl acetate. The inhibitory action of these extracts on the enzymes activity as well as their antioxidant properties was assessed. Both phenolic-rich extracts inhibited α-amylase, α-glucosidase and ACE enzyme activities in a dose dependent pattern. However, the bound phenolic extract exhibited significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher α-amylase and ACE inhibition while the free phenolic extract had significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, the free phenolic extract had higher α-glucosidase inhibitory activity when compared to that of α-amylase; this property confer an advantage on soybean phenolic-rich extracts over commercial antidiabetic drugs with little or no side effect. And inhibition of ACE suggests the antihypertension potential of soybean phenolic-rich extracts. Furthermore, the enzyme inhibitory activities of the phenolic-rich extracts were not associated with their phenolic content. Therefore, phenolic-rich extracts of soybean could inhibit key-enzyme linked to type 2 diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) and hypertension (ACE) and thus could explain in part the mechanism by which soybean renders these health promoting effect.},

Dunal (Solanaceae), namely WST and WS2, were studied in mice for immune inflammation: active paw anaphylaxis and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH). Immunomodulatory effect was assessed in If IgE-mediated anaphylaxis as reduction of ovalbumin-induced paw edema, in animals treated with WS2 at doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg, and the results were compared with the standard drug disodium chromoglycate. In the DTH model, the modulatory effect was assessed as potentiation or suppression of the reaction, revealing an increase or decrease in mean foot pad thickness, respectively. Potentiation of the DTH reaction was observed in animals treated with cyclophosphamide at a dose of 20 mg/kg, WST at a dose of 1000 mg/kg and WS2 at a dose of 300 mg/kg. On the other hand, cyclophosphamide-induced potentiation of DTH reaction was suppressed in animals treated with WST and WS2. A significant increase in white blood cell counts and platelet counts was observed in animals treated with WST. A protective effect in cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression was observed in animals treated with WST and WS2, revealing a significant increase in white blood cell counts and platelet counts. Cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression was counteracted by treatment with WS2, revealing significant increase in hemagglutinating antibody responses and hemolytic antibody responses towards sheep red blood cells.},

The study also suggested the probable physiological and molecular mechanisms of action of these treatments in this animal diabetic model. R. graveolens infusion and rutin were orally administered to diabetic rats at a dose of 125 and 50 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively, for 30 days. The results obtained revealed that both R. graveolens infusion and rutin led to significant amelioration of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, serum insulin and Cpeptide concentrations, liver glycogen content and the activities of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase as well as oxidative stress in diabetic rats. On the other hand, the in vitro and in situ studies indicated that R. graveolens infusion and rutin significantly enhanced insulin release from isolated islets of Langerhans, insulin binding to its receptors in rat diaphragm and peripheral glucose uptake by the rat diaphragm, whereas intestinal glucose and cholesterol absorption was significantly decreased. In addition, both treatment agents decreased resistin expression in adipose tissue, while rutin only was found to be effective in increasing adipose tissue peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ expression. Based on these results, the study suggested both R. graveolens and rutin to exhibit antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties via their insulinogenic effects, decreasing intestinal glucose and cholesterol absorption, improving peripheral insulin action, affecting mediators of insulin resistance, enhancing peripheral glucose uptake and decreasing hepatic glucose output in addition to the ameliorating effect on the antioxidant status in this condition.},

A high half-life time shows that turbidity is decreased slowly and that the emulsion state can be kept for a long time.

  abstract = {Epidemiological and basic science evidence suggest a possible shared pathophysiology between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has even been hypothesized that AD might be ‘type 3 diabetes’. The present review summarizes some of the evidence for the possible link, putative biochemical pathways and ongoing clinical trials of antidiabetic drugs in AD patients. The primary and review literature were searched for articles published in peer-reviewed sources that were related to a putative connection between T2DM and AD. In addition, public sources of clinical trials were searched for the relevant information regarding the testing of antidiabetic drugs in AD patients. The evidence for a connection between T2DM and AD is based upon a variety of diverse studies, but definitive biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. Additional study is needed to prove the existence or the extent of a link between T2DM and AD, but sufficient evidence exists to warrant further study. Presently, AD patients might benefit from treatment with pharmacotherapy currently used to treat T2DM and clinical trials of such therapy are currently underway.}

Naringin and its aglycone naringenin belong to this series of flavonoids and were found to display strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Several lines of investigation suggest that naringin supplementation is beneficial for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial activities have been elucidated. However, their effect on obesity and metabolic disorder remains to be fully established. Moreover, the therapeutic uses of these flavonoids are significantly limited by the lack of adequate clinical evidence. This review aims to explore the biologic activities of these compounds, particularly on lipid metabolism in obesity, oxidative stress, and inflammation in context of metabolic syndrome.}

  abstract = {Background and Objective. High-cholesterol diet (HCD) intends to increase the oxidative stress in liver tissues inducing hepatotoxicity. Rutin is a natural flavonoid (vitamin p) which is known to have antioxidative properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of Rutin on hypercholesterolemia-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Materials and Methods. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: G-I control, G-II Rutin, G-III HCD, and G-IV Rutin + HCD. The liver functions and lipid profile were used to evaluate the HCD-induced hepatotoxicity. Quantitative real time-PCR was carried out to evaluate the expression levels of genes in TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Results. Rutin in combination with HCD showed a significant protective effect against hepatotoxicity. HCD caused significant increase in the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), Mothers Against Decapentaplegic Homolog 2 (Smad-2), Mothers Against Decapentaplegic Homolog 4 (Smad-4), Bcl-2-binding component 3 (Bbc3), caspase-3, P53 and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and decrease in the expression levels of Cyclin depended kinase inhibitor (P21) and Interleukin-3 (IL-3) in hepatic cells. Conclusion. TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway is involved in HCD-induced hepatotoxicity and Rutin inhibits the hepatotoxicity via suppressing this pathway. Therefore, Rutin might be considered as a protective agent for hepatotoxicity.}

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Antimicrobial resistance became the leading cause of death globally, resulting in an urgent need for the discovery of new, safe, and efficient antibacterial agents. Compounds derived from plants can provide an essential source of new types of antibiotics. A. indica (neem) plant is rich in antimicrobial phytoconstituents. Here, we used the sensitive and reliable gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) approach, for the quantitative and quantitative determination of bioactive constituents in methanolic extract of neem leaves grown in Sudan. Subsequently, antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties were utilized using in silico tools. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The methanolic extract of neem leaves was found to have antibacterial activity against all pathogenic and reference strains. The lowest concentration reported with bacterial activity was 3.125\%, which showed zones of inhibition of more than 10 mm on P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., and E. coli, and 8 mm on Proteus spp., E. faecalis, S. epidermidis, and the pathogenic S. aureus. GC–MS analysis revealed the presence of 30 chemical compounds, including fatty acids (11), hydrocarbons (9), pyridine derivatives (2), aldehydes (2), phenol group (1), aromatic substances (1), coumarins (1), and monoterpenes (1). In silico and in vitro tools revealed that.beta.d-Mannofuranoside, O-geranyl was the most active compound on different bacterial proteins. It showed the best docking energy (-8 kcal/ mol) and best stability with different bacterial essential proteins during molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. It also had a good minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (32 μg/ml and 64 μg/ml) against S. aureus (ATCC 25,923) and E. coli (ATCC 25,922) respectively. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The methanolic extract of A. indica leaves possessed strong antibacterial activity against different types of bacteria. Beta.d-Mannofuranoside, O-geranyl was the most active compound and it passed 5 rules of drug-likeness properties. It could therefore be further processed for animal testing and clinical trials for its possible use as an antibacterial agent with commercial values.},

Rats of the HFD group were equally divided into 3 subgroups each one include 10 rats. The first group received HFD with no supplement (HFD), the 2nd group HFD+L-carnitine and the third group received HFD+HMF. Carnitine and HMF were administered at 10th week (start time for treatments) for 4 weeks. Body weight, lipid profile \& renal function (urea, uric acid creatinine) ALT \& AST activities, cardiac markers, (LDH, C.K-NAC and MB) the oxidative stress marker reduced glutathione (GSH), and Malondialdehyde (MDA) catalase activity, in addition to glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance in serum \& tissues were analyzed. Background: Obesity-associated type 2 diabetes is rapidly increasing throughout the world. It is generally recognized that natural products with a long history of safety can modulate obesity. Aim: To investigate the development of obesity in response to a high fat diet (HFD) and to estimate the effect of L-carnitine and an Egyptian Herbal mixture formulation (HMF) (consisting of T. chebula, Senae, rhubarb, black cumin, aniseed, fennel and licorice) on bodyweight, food intake, lipid profiles, renal, hepatic, cardiac function markers, lipid Peroxidation, and the glucose and insulin levels in blood and liver tissue in rats. Results: Data showed that feeding HFD diet significantly increased final body weight, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, \& LDL concentration compared with controls, while significantly decreasing HDL; meanwhile treatment with L-carnitine, or HMF significantly normalized the lipid profile. Serum ALT, urea, uric acid, creatinine, LDH, CK-NAC, CK-MB were significantly higher in the high fat group compared with normal controls; and administration of L-carnitine or herbal extract significantly lessened the effect of the HFD. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and high insulin resistance (IR) significantly increased in HFD in comparison with the control group. The treatment with L-carnitine or HMF improved the condition. HFD elevated hepatic MDA and lipid peroxidation associated with reduction in hepatic GSH and catalase activity; whereas administration of L-carnitine or herbal extract significantly ameliorated these hepatic alterations. Conclusion: HFD induced obesity associated with a disturbed lipid profile, defective antioxidant stability, and high values of IR parameters; this may have implications for the progress of obesity related problems. Treatment with L-carnitine, or HMF extract improved obesity and its associated metabolic problems in different degrees. Also HMF has antioxidant, hypolipidaemic insulin sensitizing effects. Moreover HMF might be a safe combination on the organs whose functions were examined, as a way to surmount the obesity state; and it has a distinct anti-obesity effect.}

Based on the current reality of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this study aimed to make a review literature about potential anti-coronavirus natural compounds guided by an in silico study. In the first step, essential oils from native species found in the Brazilian herbal medicine market and Brazilian species that have already shown antiviral potential were used as source for the literature search and compounds selection. Among these compounds, 184 showed high antiviral potential against rhinovirus or picornavirus by quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis. (E)-α-atlantone; 14-hydroxy-α-muurolene; allo-aromadendrene epoxide; amorpha-4,9-dien-2-ol; aristochene; azulenol; germacrene A; guaia-6,9-diene; hedycaryol; humulene epoxide II; α-amorphene; α-cadinene; α-calacorene and α-muurolene showed by a molecular docking study the best result for four target proteins that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. In addition, other parameters obtained for the selected compounds indicated low toxicity and showed good probability to achieve cell permeability and be used as a drug. These results guided the second literature search which included other species in addition to native Brazilian plants. The majority presence of any of these compounds was reported for essential oils from 45 species. In view of the few studies relating essential oils and antiviral activity, this review is important for future assays against the new coronavirus.

  abstract = {D-limonene or 4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene (C10H16) is a monocyclic monoterpene abundant in citrus plants like lemon, orange, and grape. The application of D-limonene in the form of flavor and fragrance additive in perfumes, soaps, foods, and beverages is consistently increased due to its high-quality fragrance property. This review is intended to analyze and delineate every possible available evidence and details about D-limonene with the special focus on its therapeutic efficacy. Many studies have reported that D-limonene effectively plays a valuable role in the prevention of several chronic and degenerative diseases. This review provides worthy information about the beneficial effects of D-limonene such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, hepatoprotective, immune modulatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-genotoxic etc. This could in turn help in the application of D-limonene for clinical studies. Practical implications Various plant families contain Terpenes as their secondary metabolites. Monoterpenes constitute an important part of these secondary metabolites. D-limonene is a well-identified monoterpene that is commonly applied as a fragrance ingredient in essential oils. D-limonene is known to possess remarkable biological activities. It can be effectively used for treating various ailments and diseases. Due to its diverse functions, it can be efficiently utilized for human health.},

Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant role of bacoside A (triterpenoid saponin isolated from Bacopa monniera) against chronic cigarette smoking induced oxidative damage in rat brain. Adult male albino rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for a period of 12 weeks and simultaneously administered with bacoside A (10 mg/kg b.w./day, p.o.). Antioxidant status of the brain was assessed from the levels of reduced glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin A and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. The levels of copper, iron, zinc and selenium in brain and serum ceruloplasmin activity were also measured. Oxidative stress was evident from the diminished levels of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Alterations in the levels of trace elements with accumulation of copper and iron, and depletion of zinc and selenium were also observed. Bacoside A administration improved the antioxidant status and maintained the levels of trace elements. These results suggest that chronic cigarette smoke exposure enhances oxidative stress, thereby disturbing the tissue defense system and bacoside A protects the brain from the oxidative damage through its antioxidant potential. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, China is now the only country in Asia where HBV endemicity is high. Countries with intermediate endemicity include India, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand, and those with low endemicity include Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. Most countries in Africa have high HBV endemicity, with the exceptions of Tunisia and Morocco, which have intermediate endemicity. Zambia has borderline intermediate/high endemicity. In the Middle East, Bahrain, Iran, Israel and Kuwait are areas of low endemicity, Cyprus, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates have intermediate endemicity, and Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, Yemen and Saudi Arabia have high endemicity. All of these Middle East countries reach a large proportion of their population with hepatitis B vaccination, which is reducing the infection rate, particularly in Saudi Arabia. The vaccination programme in Taiwan has also greatly reduced the HBV infection rate. Future vaccination programmes must take into account the mode of transmission of HBV, the healthcare infrastructure to deliver vaccination, and the socioeconomic and political factors in each individual country, to determine the most cost-effective way of infection control.

The antibacterial activities of flavonoids, in combination with morin and rutin, were evaluated, based on the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in a liquid culture, by using Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus cereus as the test bacteria. The activities of galangin, kaempherol, myricetin and fisetin were each enhanced in the presence of rutin when S. enteritidis was used as the test bacterium. The MIC value for kaempherol was markedly decreased by the addition of rutin. Morin inhibited DNA synthesis, and this effect was promoted by rutin at a concentration of 25 microg/ml.},

Most of the studies reveal the inference of oxidative stress in diabetes pathogenesis by the alteration in enzymatic systems, lipid peroxidation, impaired Glutathione metabolism and decreased Vitamin C levels. Lipids, proteins, DNA damage, Glutathione, catalane and superoxide dismutase are various biomarkers of oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus. Oxidative stress induced complications of diabetes may include stroke, neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy. The basic aim of this review was to summarize the basics of oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus.}

Partial acetolysis of the acetylated polysaccharide complex, followed by deacetylation of the products, gives a similar mixture of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides together with 2-O-α-L-fucopyranosyl-D-xylose, 2-O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-D-xylose, and acidic oligosaccharides containing galacturonic acid and contiguous rhamnose residues. Enzymic hydrolysis of partially degraded polysaccharide furnishes 3-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-D-galacturonic acid and higher acidic oligosaccharides containing chains of 1 → 4 linked β-D-galactopyranose residues. Partial structures for the polysaccharide complex are discussed in the light of these and previous results, and the known structural features are compared with those of pectic acids and tragacanthic acid.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Citrus flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds with powerful biological properties. This review aims to summarize recent advances towards understanding the ability of citrus flavonoids to regulate lipid metabolism and other metabolic parameters relevant to the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Citrus flavonoids, including naringenin, hesperidin, nobiletin and tangeretin, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of metabolic dysregulation. Epidemiological studies report that intake of citrus flavonoid-containing foods attenuates cardiovascular diseases. Experimental and a limited number of clinical studies reveal lipid-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory properties. In animal models, citrus flavonoid supplements prevent hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia and insulin sensitivity primarily through inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Citrus flavonoids blunt the inflammatory response in metabolically important tissues including liver, adipose tissue, kidney and the aorta. The mechanisms underlying flavonoid-induced metabolic regulation have not been completely established. In mouse models, citrus flavonoids show marked suppression of atherogenesis through improved metabolic parameters and also through direct impact on the vessel wall. SUMMARY: These recent studies suggest an important role of citrus flavonoids in the treatment of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, obesity and atherosclerosis. The favorable outcomes are achieved through multiple mechanisms. Human studies focussed on dose, bioavailability, efficacy and safety are required to propel the use of these promising therapeutic agents into the clinical arena. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes and its related complications are now a global health problem without an effective therapeutic approach. There are many herbal medicines which have attracted much attention as potential therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications due to their multiple targets. AIM: The aim of this study is to review available knowledge of mangiferin focusing on its mode of action. METHODS: Mangiferin was extensively reviewed for its antidiabetic activity using online database like Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar as well as some offline textbooks. A critical discussion based on the mechanism of action and the future perspectives is also given in the present manuscript. RESULTS: Mangiferin is a natural C-glucoside and mainly obtained from its primary source, the leaves of mango tree (Mangifera indica L.). Therapeutic and preventive properties of mangiferin include antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiallergic, neuroprotective, and cognition-enhancing effects. It dissolves well in water, so it can be easily extracted into infusions and decoctions and hence, a number of researches have been made on the therapeutic effect of this molecule. Recently, mangiferin has been proved to be an effective remedy in diabetes and diabetes-related complications. It is a beneficial natural compound for type 2 diabetes mellitus as it improves insulin sensitivity, modulates lipid profile and reverts adipokine levels to normal. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that mangiferin has the potential to treat diabetes and it can be developed as a therapeutic agent for diabetes and the complications caused by diabetes.},

The neuroprotective and anti-aging potentials of EOs and their possible mechanism of actions were evaluated by numerous researchers around the globe. Several clinically important EOs and their components from Nigella sativa, Acorus gramineus, Lavandula angustifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Jasminum sambac, Piper nigrum and so many other plants are reported for neuroprotective effects. This review article was aimed to summarize the current finding on EOs tested against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia. The effects of EOs on pathological targets of AD and dementia including amyloid deposition (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic hypofunction, oxidative stress and glutamatergic abnormalities were focused. Furthermore, effects of EOs on other neurological disorders including anxiety, depression, cognitive hypofunction epilepsy and convulsions were also evaluated in detail. In conclusion, EOs were effective on several pathological targets and have improved cognitive performance in animal models and human subjects. Thus, EOs can be developed as multi-potent agents against neurological disorders with better efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness.},

We report a computational approach that combines different sources of drug and protein interaction information to assemble the myocardial infarction drug-target interactome network (My-DTome). My-DTome comprises approved and other drugs interlinked in a single, highly-connected network with modular organization. We show that approved and other drugs may both be highly connected and represent network bottlenecks. This highlights influential roles for such drugs on seemingly unrelated targets and pathways via direct and indirect interactions. My-DTome modules are associated with relevant molecular processes and pathways. We find evidence that these modules may be regulated by microRNAs with potential therapeutic roles in MI. Different drugs can jointly impact a module. We provide systemic insights into cardiovascular effects of non-cardiovascular drugs. My-DTome provides the basis for an alternative approach to investigate new targets and multidrug treatment in MI.}

  abstract = {The purpose of the present investigation was to develop and evaluate a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for improving the oral absorption of a pranlukast hemihydrate (PLH), a very poorly water-soluble drug. An efficient self-microemulsifying vehicle for PLH was selected and optimized using solubility testing and phase diagram construction. The formulations were characterized by assessing self-emulsification performance, droplet size analysis, in vitro drug release characteristics and formulation stability studies. Optimized formulations for in vitro dissolution and bioavailability assessment were Triethylcitrate (TEC; 10\%), Tween 20 (50\%), Span 20 (25\%), triethanolamine (5\%), and benzyl alcohol (10\%). The SMEDDS readily released the lipid phase to form a fine oil-in-water microemulsion with a narrow distribution size. Saturated solubilities of PLH from SMEDDS in water, pH 4.0 and 6.8, were over 150 times greater than that of plain PLH. The release of 100\% PLH from SMEDDS was considerably greater compared to only 1.12\% in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8) from plain PLH after 2 hours. The PLH suspension with 0.5\% sodium carboxymethylcellulose or 3\% PLH-loaded SMEDDS was administrated at a dose of 40 mg/kg as PLH to fasted rats. The absorption of PLH from SMEDDS resulted in about a threefold increase in bioavailability compared with plain PLH aqueous suspension. Our studies illustrated that the potential use of the new SMEDDS can be used as a possible alternative to oral delivery of a poorly water-soluble drug such as PLH.},

Formed by uniting the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities, the UniProt consortium produces three layers of protein sequence databases: the UniProt Archive (UniParc), the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProt) and the UniProt Reference (UniRef) databases. The UniProt Knowledgebase is a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase with extensive cross-references. This centrepiece consists of two sections: UniProt/Swiss-Prot, with fully, manually curated entries; and UniProt/TrEMBL, enriched with automated classification and annotation. During 2004, tens of thousands of Knowledgebase records got manually annotated or updated; we introduced a new comment line topic: TOXIC DOSE to store information on the acute toxicity of a toxin; the UniProt keyword list got augmented by additional keywords; we improved the documentation of the keywords and are continuously overhauling and standardizing the annotation of post-translational modifications. Furthermore, we introduced a new documentation file of the strains and their synonyms. Many new database cross-references were introduced and we started to make use of Digital Object Identifiers. We also achieved in collaboration with the Macromolecular Structure Database group at EBI an improved integration with structural databases by residue level mapping of sequences from the Protein Data Bank entries onto corresponding UniProt entries. For convenient sequence searches we provide the UniRef non-redundant sequence databases. The comprehensive UniParc database stores the complete body of publicly available protein sequence data. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). New releases are published every two weeks.},

Lecithin dispersions were seen to contain spherulites composed of concentric lamellae. The width of the lipid layer was estimated to be 44 Å. Rod-shaped elements were also observed and interpreted as being groups of lipid molecules arranged at right angles to the long axis of the lamellae. Preparations of lecithin-cholesterol of equal molar proportions were described as being basically the same as lecithin alone. Saponin modified the lamellar structure of lecithin-cholesterol in such a way as to produce an array of perforations with a centre-to-centre spacing of 120 Å and with a diameter of 85 Å. Separated rings together with helical structures estimated to be 220 Å in diameter with an axial hole of 68 Å were described. The helical structures showed a well-defined periodicity of 58 to 59 Å along the axis. Lecithin dispersions were shown to be progressively disrupted after mixing with lysolecithin in water. Beading of the lamellae was a pronounced feature. Lecithin progesterone dispersions in water produced a line structure of about 20 to 22 Å across. © 1964, Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd..

In additional experiments, the renal hemodynamic and blood pressure responses to graded doses of an inhibitor of NO synthesis (Nitro-L-arginine; NLA) were measured. We found that plasma and urinary levels of NO2/NO3 are significantly higher in STZ diabetic rats (10 to 15 days) than in normal rats. Renal blood flow and GFR fell comparably in diabetic and normal rats in response to NLA infusion, although the absolute levels of RBF and GFR remained significantly higher in the diabetic rats at all doses of the inhibitor. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) rose in response to NLA administration, but the increase in the diabetic rats was significantly blunted as compared with the normal rats. Similarly, renal vascular resistance (RVR) increased less in the diabetic than in the normal rats at comparable doses of NLA. The blunted vasoconstrictor responses to NLA were accompanied by a smaller reduction in the levels of NO2-/NO3- in the urine of the diabetic versus the normal rats. These findings suggest that NO synthesis is increased in diabetic rats manifesting hyperfiltration and are consistent with the view that excess NO synthesis contributes to renal hyperfiltration.},

This Review focuses on the nature and source of AGEs/ALEs and the factors affecting their formation in tissue and plasma proteins. Lipids are identified as an important source of chemical modification of proteins in diabetes, and the role of diabetes, dyslipidemia and renal disease in formation of AGEs/ALEs is reviewed. The article concludes with a discussion of ELISA assays for AGEs/ALEs and the merits of measuring AGEs/ALEs in the clinical laboratory.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress and oxidative damage to tissues are common end points of chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. The question addressed in this review is whether increased oxidative stress has a primary role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications or whether it is a secondary indicator of end-stage tissue damage in diabetes. The increase in glycoxidation and lipoxidation products in plasma and tissue proteins suggests that oxidative stress is increased in diabetes. However, some of these products, such as 3-deoxyglucosone adducts to lysine and arginine residues, are formed independent of oxidation chemistry. Elevated levels of oxidizable substrates may also explain the increase in glycoxidation and lipoxidation products in tissue proteins, without the necessity of invoking an increase in oxidative stress. Further, age-adjusted levels of oxidized amino acids, a more direct indicator of oxidative stress, are not increased in skin collagen in diabetes. We propose that the increased chemical modification of proteins by carbohydrates and lipids in diabetes is the result of overload on metabolic pathways involved in detoxification of reactive carbonyl species, leading to a general increase in steady-state levels of reactive carbonyl compounds formed by both oxidative and nonoxidative reactions. The increase in glycoxidation and lipoxidation of tissue proteins in diabetes may therefore be viewed as the result of increased carbonyl stress. The distinction between oxidative and carbonyl stress is discussed along with the therapeutic implications of this difference.}

  abstract = {Herbal therapy is becoming increasingly popular among patients and physicians. Many herbal preparations are marketed to the public for various ailments including those of the skin. Herbal therapies have been used successfully in treating dermatologic disorders for thousands of years in Europe and Asia. In Germany, a regulatory commission oversees herbal preparations and recommended uses. In Asia, herbal treatments that have been used for centuries are now being studied scientifically. Currently, the United States does not regulate herbal products, as they are considered dietary supplements. Therefore, there is no standardization of active ingredients, purity, or concentration. There are also no regulations governing which herbs can be marketed for various ailments. This has made learning about and using these treatments challenging. Information compiled in a practical fashion may enable more patients to benefit from these treatments currently used worldwide. We reviewed the herbal medications that show scientific evidence of clinical efficacy, as well as the more common herbs shown to be useful in the treatment of dermatologic disorders. The safety of each herb has been addressed to better enable the physician to know which herbal therapies they may want to begin to use in practice. Common drug interactions and side effects of herbal medicines that may be seen in the dermatologic setting were also studied.}

Oral administrations of NXQ at 20, 40, 80 mg/kg/day for 7 days (3 days before MCAO and 4 days after MCAO) significantly reduced the lesion of the insulted brain hemisphere and improved the neurological behavior of the rats. In primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures, treatment with NXQ at 5-20 μg mL concentration protects the neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxic death in a dose-dependent manner. In primary rat cerebral cortical neuron cultures, pretreatment with 5 -100 μg/mL NXQ also attenuates hypoxia-reoxygen induced neuron death and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that NXQ significantly protects the rats from MCAO ischemic injury in vivo and the hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury as well as cortical neurons from hypoxia injury in vitro by synergistic mechanisms involving its antioxidative effects. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.},

  abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Flavonoids, extracted from the leaves of Diospyros kaki, are the main therapeutic components of NaoXingQing (NXQ), a potent and patented Chinese herbal remedy widely used in China for the treatment of apoplexy syndrome. Aim of the study: To investigate the neuroprotective effects of FLDK-P70, a standardized flavonoid extract, using in vivo rat models of both focal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and on transient global brain ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion (4-VO). We also aim to examine the effects of FLDK-P70 on glutamate-induced cell injury of hippocampal neurons as well as on hypoxia-induced injury of cortical neurons in primary cell culture. Materials and methods and results: Administration of FLDK-P70 for 12 days (40, 80 mg/kg body weight, p.o., 5 days before and 7 days after 4-VO) increased the survival of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after transient global brain ischemia. Similarly, administration of FLDK-P70 for 7 days (40, 80 mg/kg body weight, p.o., 3 days before and 4 days after MCAO) significantly reduced the lesion of the insulted brain hemisphere and improved the neurological behavior of rats. In primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures, pretreatment with FLDK-P70 (5, 10 μg/ml) protected neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner. In primary rat cerebral cortical neuronal culture, pretreatment with FLDK-P70 (25, 100 μg/ml) also reduced hypoxia-reoxygen induced neuronal death and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that FLDK-P70 significantly protects rats from MCAO and 4-VO ischemic injury in vivo and protects hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury as well as cortical neurons from hypoxia-induced injury in vitro. The mechanisms of these effects may be due to the antioxidative activity of the flavonoids. These results convincingly demonstrate that FLDK-P70 may be useful for the prevention and treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury and other related neurodegenerative diseases. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Proteins, polysaccharides and their blends, as examples of natural biopolymers, are surface active materials. Biopolymers may be considered as amphiphilic macromolecules that play an essential role in stabilizing food formulations (foams, emulsions and dispersions). Under specific conditions (such as protein-to-polysaccharide ratio, pH, ionic strength, temperature, mixing processing), it has been stated that proteins and polysaccharides form hybrids (complexes) with enhanced functional properties in comparison to the proteins and polysaccharides alone. Different protein-polysaccharide pairs are reviewed with particular attention to the emulsification capability of their mixtures. In the case of uncomplexed blends of biopolymers, competitive adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces is generally reported. Conversely, electrostatic complexation between oppositely charged proteins and polysaccharides allows better anchoring of the new-formed macro-molecular amphiphile onto oil-water interfaces. Moreover, improved thermal stability and increased resistance to external treatment (high pressure) involved in food processing are obtained. This review presents basic and applied knowledge on protein-polysaccharide interactions in aqueous medium and at the oil-water interface in food emulsion systems. Electrostatic interactions and thermodynamic incompatibility in mixed biopolymer solutions are correlated to the functional properties (rheology, surface hydrophobiciry, emulsification power) of these interesting blends. Basic and industrial selected systems of different families of hydrocolloids (as gum Arabic, galactomannans, pectins) and protein (caseins, whey, soya, gelatin) mixtures are reviewed.},

By considering drug actions and side effects in the context of the regulatory networks within which the drug targets and disease gene products function, network analysis promises to greatly increase our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the multiple actions of drugs. Systems pharmacology can provide new approaches for drug discovery for complex diseases. The integrated approach used in systems pharmacology can allow for drug action to be considered in the context of the whole genome. Network-based studies are becoming an increasingly important tool in understanding the relationships between drug action and disease susceptibility genes. This review discusses how analysis of biological networks has contributed to the genesis of systems pharmacology and how these studies have improved global understanding of drug targets, suggested new targets and approaches for therapeutics, and provided a deeper understanding of the effects of drugs.

The journal is devoted to the promotion of health sciences and related disciplines (including medicine, pharmacy, nursing, biotechnology, cell and molecular biology, and related engineering fields). It seeks particularly (but not exclusively) to encourage multidisciplinary research and collaboration among scientists, the industry and the healthcare professionals. It will also provide an international forum for the communication and evaluation of data, methods and findings in health sciences and related disciplines. The journal welcomes original research papers, reviews and case reports on current topics of special interest and relevance. All manuscripts will be subject to rapid peer review. Those of high quality (not previously published and not under consideration for publication) will be published without delay. The maximum length of manuscripts should normally be 10,000 words (20 single-spaced typewritten pages) for review, 6,000 words for research articles, 3,000 for technical notes, case reports, commentaries and short communications. Abstract Lipid solubility and molecular size are the major limiting factors for molecules to pass the biological membrane to be absorbed systematically following oral or topical administration. Several plant extracts and phytoconstituents, despite having excellent bio-activity in vitro demonstrate less or no in vivo actions due to their poor lipid solubility or improper molecular size or both, resulting poor absorption and poor bioavailability. It is often found that, when individual constituents are isolated from the plant extract there is loss of specific bio-activity. Sometimes some constituents of the multi-constituent plant extract are destroyed in gastric environment when taken orally. Phytosomes are advanced forms of herbal formulations that are better absorbed, and as a result produce better bioavailability and actions than the conventional herbal extracts. They are produced by a patented process whereby the standardized plant extract or its constituents are bound to phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine, producing a lipid compatible molecular complex. This phyto-phospholipid complex (phytosome) resembles a little cell. Phytosomes exhibit better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile than conventional herbal extracts. Phytosome technology has been effectively used to enhanced the bioavailability of many popular herbal extracts including milk thistle, Ginkgo biloba, grape seed, green tea, hawthorn, ginseng etc and can be developed for various therapeutic uses or dietary supplements.},

  abstract = {Vacuum freeze-drying of biological materials is one of the best methods of water removal, with final products of highest quality. The solid state of water during freeze-drying protects the primary structure and the shape of the products with minimal volume reduction. In addition, the lower temperatures in the process allow maximal nutrient and bioactive compound retention. This technique has been successfully applied to diverse biological materials, such as meats, coffee, juices, dairy products, cells, and bacteria, and is standard practice for penicillin, hormones, blood plasma, vitamin preparations, etc. Despite its many advantages, having four to ten times more energy requirements than regular hot air drying, freeze-drying has always been recognized as the most expensive process for manufacturing a dehydrated product. The application of the freeze-drying process to plant-based foods has been traditionally dedicated to the production of space shuttle goods, military or extreme-sport foodstuffs, and specialty foods such as coffee or spices. Recently, the market for ‘natural’ and ‘organic’ products is, however, strongly growing as well as the consumer’s demand for foods with minimal processing and high quality. From this perspective, the market for freeze-dried plant-based foods is not only increasing but also diversifying. Freeze-dried fruits and vegetables chunks, pieces, or slices are nowadays majorly used in a wide range of food products such as confectionaries, morning cereals, soups, bakeries, meal boxes, etc. Instant drinks are prepared out of freeze-dried tea, coffee, or even from maple syrup enriched with polyphenol concentrated extracts from trees. The possibilities are endless. In this review, the application of freeze-drying to transform plant-based foods was analyzed, based on the recent research publications on the subject and personal unpublished data. The review is structured around the following related topics: latest applications of freeze-drying to plant-based foods, specific technological problems that could be found when freeze-drying such products (i.e., presence of cuticle; high sugar or lipid concentration), pretreatments and intensification technologies employed in freeze-drying of plant-based foods, and quality issues of these freeze-dried products.},

The degradation of hyaluronan is linked to a wide range of physiological and pathological process. Inhibiting the hyaluronidase enzyme is thus significant as an approach to treat a variety of diseases and health conditions such as anti-fertility, anti-tumor, antimicrobial, and anti-venom/toxin agents. HAase inhibitors of different chemical types have been identified include both synthetic compounds and constituents obtained from naturally sources. Plant natural products as HAase inhibitors are unique due to their structural features and diversity. Medicinal plants have historically been used as contraceptives, antidote for snakebites and to promote wound healing. In recent years, small molecules, particularly plant natural products (alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenol and flavonoids, triterpenes and steroids) possessing potent HAase have been discovered. A number of plant species from various families, which have folk medicinal claims for these ailments (related to hyaluronan disturbances) were scientifically proven for their potential to block HAase enzymes.},

  abstract = {Food nanotechnology encompasses applications related to development of new functional materials (for protection and delivery of food bioactive compounds) and packaging applications (for improved food safety and biosecurity). In recent years, the delivery of micronutrients and nutraceuticals at nanoscale has been widely studied as these systems have the potential to improve the solubility, stability and bioavailability of food bioactives to a greater extent. The nanodelivery systems typically consist of the food bioactive compound encapsulated and stabilized in food grade ingredients, such as lipids, proteins or polysaccharides with diameters ranging from 10~nm to 1000~nm. The solubility and permeability characteristics of the nutrient to be encapsulated play a crucial role in selection of a suitable nanodelivery system. Lipid-based delivery systems such as nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoliposomes and micelles are widely studied for the delivery of lipophilic bioactive compounds. On the other hand, the hydrophilic bioactives are delivered through protein; polysaccharide or biopolymer-based colloidal nanosystems, such as hydrogels, nanogels and polymer nanoparticles. This chapter discusses on the techniques for nanoencapsulation of nutrients along with various nanodelivery systems. Further, the nutrient bioavailability enhancement of nanodelivery systems is also discussed in detail.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anticancer activity of the novel natural product dammarane-type triterpene sapogenin (20(S)-25-OCH3-PPD; PPD25) isolated from the leaves of Panax notoginseng. 2. The anticancer activity of PPD25 was evaluated in three colon cancer cell lines and in one lung cancer cell line. The effects of PPD25 to inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis were evaluated. In addition, the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of PPD25 were investigated. 3. It was found that the addition of 5 or 25 micromol/L PPD25 to the culture medium significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in all four cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that PPD25 significantly reduced the expression of beta-catenin, a key mediator in the Wnt pathway, as well as transcriptional targets of beta-catenin, namely c-myc, cyclin D1, cdk4 and T cell factor (TCF)-4. In addition, beta-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity was significantly suppressed by PPD25. 4. The data demonstrate that the PPD25 exerts its anticancer effect by targetting beta-catenin signalling, suggesting that PPD25 may have potential as a chemotherapeutic and/or chemopreventive agent for colon and lung cancer.},

Most work has been directed towards structural proteins which may be present for many years and would continue to accumulate sugar residues. As glycation is a non-specific reaction, other proteins such as enzymes will also be susceptible to glycation and could well display altered activity. We investigated the effect of various sugars whose concentrations increase in diabetes in insulin-independent tissues on glutathione reductase, an enzyme that maintains the GSH level in cells. Glucose, glucose 6-phosphate and fructose all displayed a time-dependent inhibition of glutathione reductase activity, suggesting that these sugars glycate this enzyme. Aspirin gave some protection against the loss of activity induced by glucose.}

  abstract = {The International League of Dermatological Societies (ILDS), a global, not-for-profit organization representing 157 dermatological societies worldwide, has identified the consequences of skin aging as one of the most important grand challenges in global skin health. Reduced functional capacity and increased susceptibility of the skin with development of dermatoses such as dry skin, itching, ulcers, dyspigmentation, wrinkles, fungal infections, as well as benign and malignant tumors are the most common skin conditions in aged populations worldwide. Environmental (e.g., pollution) and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, sunbed use) negatively affect skin health. In turn altered appearance, dry skin, chronic wounds, and other conditions decrease general health and reduce the likelihood for healthy and active aging. Preventive skin care includes primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions. Continuous sun protection from early childhood onward is most important, to avoid extrinsic skin damage and skin cancer. Exposure to irritants, allergens, or other molecules damaging the skin must be avoided or reduced to a minimum. Public health approaches are needed to implement preventive and basic skin care worldwide to reach high numbers of dermatological patients and care receivers. Education of primary caregivers and implementation of community dermatology are successful strategies in resource-poor countries. Besides specialist physicians, nurses and other health care professionals play important roles in preventing and managing age-related skin conditions in developing as well as in developed countries. Healthy skin across the life course leads to better mental and emotional health, positive impact on social engagement, and healthier, more active, and productive lives. The skin is the largest organ of the human body that fulfills multiple essential tasks. It forms the boundary between the inside and outside. It provides protection against mechanical and chemical threats, it provides innate and adaptive immune defenses, it enables thermoregulation and vitamin D production, and it acts as the sensory organ of touch (Chuong et al., 2002). Like every other complex biological system, the skin grows, matures, and ages throughout the life course. Skin aging is associated with a reduction in functional capacity that itself increases the susceptibility to cutaneous problems and the subsequent development of dermatoses and skin cancers. As well as changes in cuta-neous structure and function, its appearance is the key observable marker of the overall aging process. Thus, our},

  abstract = {In-depth conformational analyses of 10 known eremophilane (= (1S,4aR,7R,8aR)-decahydro-1,8a-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)napththalene) sesquiterpenes, 1-10, from Petasites hybridus were performed with molecular mechanics as well as density functional theory methods. Electronic transition energies and rotational strengths of these eight eremophilane lactones and two petasins were calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (B3PW91/TZVP). The absolute configurations of the constituents could be assigned by comparison of their simulated and experimental circular dichroism (CD) spectra in methanol as (4S,5R,8S,10R) (1, 2), (2R,4S,5R,8S,10R) (3, 4, 5), (2R,4S,5R,8R,9R,10R) (6), (2R,4S,5R,8R,10R) (7, 8), and (3R,4R,5R) (9, 10). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 8beta-hydroxyeremophilanolide ((8S)-8-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide) (1) served as starting point for the theoretical conformational calculations of the 8beta-epimers of the eremophilane lactones. Experimental CD spectra as well as (1)H NMR spectra of compound 1 in methanol were considerably dependent on sample concentration.},

  abstract = {Of the three established isoforms of NO synthase, the gene for the neuronal-type enzyme (NOS I) is by far the largest and most complicated one. The genomic locus of the human NOS I gene is located on chromosome 12 and distributed over a region greater than 200 kb. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the major neuronal mRNA transcript is encoded by 29 exons. The full-length open reading frame codes for a protein of 1434 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 160.8 kDa. However, both in rodents and in humans, multiple, tissue-specific or developmentally regulated NOS I mRNA transcripts have been reported. They arise from the initiation by different transcriptional units containing alternative promoters (at least eight in the human gene), cassette exon deletions or insertions, and/or the usage of alternate polyadenylation signals. Depending on the insertions and deletions, translation results in functional or nonfunctional proteins. The use of alternative promoters can influence gene expression by various means. Indeed, NOS I is not a static, constitutively expressed enzyme, but subject to expressional regulation by various compounds and conditions. The molecular mechanisms underlying these regulations are currently being studied in several laboratories including our own.}

  abstract = {Relative hypoxia is essential in wound healing since it normally plays a pivotal role in regulation of all the critical processes involved in tissue repair. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α is the critical transcription factor that regulates adaptive responses to hypoxia. HIF-1α stability and function is regulated by oxygen-dependent soluble hydroxylases targeting critical proline and asparaginyl residues. Here we show that hyperglycemia complexly affects both HIF-1α stability and activation, resulting in suppression of expression of HIF-1 target genes essential for wound healing both in vitro and in vivo. However, by blocking HIF-1α hydroxylation through chemical inhibition, it is possible to reverse this negative effect of hyperglycemia and to improve the wound healing process (i.e., granulation, vascularization, epidermal regeneration, and recruitment of endothelial precursors). Local adenovirus-mediated transfer of two stable HIF constructs demonstrated that stabilization of HIF-1α is necessary and sufficient for promoting wound healing in a diabetic environment. Our findings outline the necessity to develop specific hydroxylase inhibitors as therapeutic agents for chronic diabetes wounds. In conclusion, we demonstrate that impaired regulation of HIF-1α is essential for the development of diabetic wounds, and we provide evidence that stabilization of HIF-1α is critical to reverse the pathological process.}

This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents. Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls. © 1976.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the biochemical basis of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (A-ADHD), we compared lipid peroxidation status in the plasma of A-ADHD patients, and that of control subjects without A-ADHD by quantifying the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of fatty acid oxidation. We aimed to examine the association between MDA and A-ADHD. METHOD: The study comprised 20 A-ADHD patients from Gaziantep University Sahinbey Research Hospital Psychiatry Clinic, diagnosed by 2 psychiatrists (H.A.S. and S.S.) according to the Turkish version of the adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale, and 21 healthy volunteers. Malondialdehyde levels were measured in plasma samples of both study groups. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) MDA levels in patients (2.44 [0.84] nmol/mL) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (0.36 [0.20] nmol/mL) (t=11.013, df=39, p{$<$}0.01). MDA levels were correlated with overall number of criteria met (n=20, p=0.01, Ro=0.56) and total hyperactivity/impulsivity score (n=20, p=0.02, Ro=0.51). CONCLUSION: The fact that MDA levels were increased in A-ADHD could be an indication of increased oxidative stress in this disease. We suggest that such changes may have a pathological role in A-ADHD. This is the first study evaluating the MDA levels in A-ADHD, and our findings may provide a scientific guide for the further clinical enzymologic and biochemical studies on this disorder.},

In recent years, concern regarding the possible content of anthraquinones in noni has led to scrutiny by the European Food Safety Authority. Little research existed on the content of anthraquinones in different noni preparations, with no information about the potential effect of harvest and preparation methods. Our research focused on lucidin, alizarin, and rubiadin, the most important anthraquinones from a health perspective. We found that the production process (fermentation/juice production versus drying/lyophilization) has no effect on the anthraquinone content. The source product, however, does have implications: noni fruit puree from which seeds had been removed as well as consumer products produced from such puree had no detectable amounts of any anthraquinones. Products that did contain seed or leaf material in all cases did contain partly significant amounts of anthraquinones. To alleviate safety concerns, we suggest that noni products, whether fermented or unfermented juice or powder, should be derived only from fully ripe noni fruits, and that any seed material needs to be removed during the production process.}

  abstract = {Chemical preservatives have potential safety hazards, which may pose threats to human health. Safer biopreservatives are therefore urgently required. This study investigated the bacteriostatic activity and mechanism of Litsea mollis Hemsl. essential oil against Escherichia coli DH5α and Salmonella spp. Antibacterial activity of Litsea mollis Hemsl. essential oil 9 (LMEO9) against E. coli DH5α was observed (zone of inhibition was 5.0 ± 0.2 mm; minimum inhibitory concentration was 0.05\%). Increases in electrolyte, nucleic acid, and alkaline phosphatase leakage in LMEO9-treated bacteria suggested that the cell envelope had been damaged. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy also demonstrated morphological alterations and content leakage during LMEO9 treatment. According to the kill-time analysis and propidium iodide uptake assay, LMEO9 led to cell death. These results demonstrated that LMEO9, which could affect bacterial cell envelope structural integrity, is a low-cost biopreservative that could be useful for the dairy industry and in fresh storage.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES Study aims were to evaluate effects of Bacopa monnieri whole plant standardized dry extract on cognitive function and affect and its safety and tolerability in healthy elderly study participants. DESIGN The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a placebo run-in of 6 weeks and a treatment period of 12 weeks. SETTING/LOCATION Volunteers were recruited from the community to a clinic in Portland, Oregon by public notification. SUBJECTS Fifty-four (54) participants, 65 or older (mean 73.5 years), without clinical signs of dementia, were recruited and randomized to Bacopa or placebo. Forty-eight (48) completed the study with 24 in each group. INTERVENTIONS Standardized B. monnieri extract 300 mg/day or a similar placebo tablet orally for 12 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome variable was the delayed recall score from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Other cognitive measures were the Stroop Task assessing the ability to ignore irrelevant information, the Divided Attention Task (DAT), and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) letter-digit test of immediate working memory. Affective measures were the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD)-10 depression scale, and the Profile of Mood States. Vital signs were also monitored. RESULTS Controlling for baseline cognitive deficit using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test, Bacopa participants had enhanced AVLT delayed word recall memory scores relative to placebo. Stroop results were similarly significant, with the Bacopa group improving and the placebo group unchanged. CESD-10 depression scores, combined state plus trait anxiety scores, and heart rate decreased over time for the Bacopa group but increased for the placebo group. No effects were found on the DAT, WAIS digit task, mood, or blood pressure. The dose was well tolerated with few adverse events (Bacopa n = 9, placebo n = 10), primarily stomach upset. CONCLUSIONS This study provides further evidence that B. monnieri has potential for safely enhancing cognitive performance in the aging.},

  abstract = {Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a sustainable innovative technology that allows for the recovery of nutrients and bioactive compounds from vegetable matrices. A. bisporus was chosen for its nutritional value and the effect of PEF pretreatment was evaluated using different conditions of electric field (2–3 kV/cm), specific energy (50–200 kJ/kg) and extraction time (0–6 h) to obtain the best conditions for nutrient and bioactive compound extraction. Spectrophotometric methods were used to evaluate the different compounds, along with an analysis of mineral content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the surface was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the results were compared with those obtained by conventional extraction (under constant shaking without PEF pretreatment). After evaluating the extractions, the best extraction conditions were 2.5 kV/cm, 50 kJ/kg and 6 h which showed that PEF extraction increased the recovery of total phenolic compounds in 96.86\%, carbohydrates in 105.28\%, proteins in 11.29\%, and minerals such as P, Mg, Fe and Se. These results indicate that PEF pretreatment is a promising sustainable technology to improve the extraction of compounds and minerals from mushrooms showing microporation on the surface, positioning them as a source of compounds of great nutritional interest.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to evaluate the potential use of leaf detritus by chironomid larvae. Field and laboratory experiments were performed using leaves and chironomid species collected in Portugal and Brazil. Laboratory experiments under controlled conditions were done using microbial conditioned senescent leaves of Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn, Neriumoleander L., Protium heptaphilum (Aubl.) March, Protium brasiliense (Spreng) Engl., Myrcia guyanensis(Aubl.) DC and Miconia chartacea Triana. Laboratory experiments were performed using specimens collected from leaf litter in local streams. Whenever possible, after the experiments, chironomids were allowed to emerge as adults and identified. In Portugal the following taxa were identified: Micropsectra apposita (Walker, 1856), Polypedilum albicorne (Meigen, 1838),Eukiefferiella claripennis Lundbeck (1898), Rheocricotopus (Psilocricotopus) atripes Rempel (1937) and Ablabesmyia Johannsen (1905) (Diptera, Chironomidae). Consumption rates ranged from 0.15 ± 0.10 mg (AFDM) of leaf animal-1 day-1 (Micropsectra apposita feeding on Alnus glutinosa) up to 0.85 ± 0.33 mg (AFDM) of leaf animal-1 day-1 (Polypedilum albicorne feeding on Miconia chartacea). In Brazil, the following taxa were identified from leaves: Phaenopsectra sp., Chironomus spp. and Polypedilum sp. and maximum consumption rates reached 0.47 ± 0.28 (AFDM) of leaf mg.animal-1.day-1 (Chironomus Meigen (1803) feeding on Protium heptaphilum). Feeding experiments with laboratory cultured specimens, revealed that some chironomids were unable to feed on decomposing leaves (e.g., C. xanthus Rempel (1939) on P.brasiliensis and M.guyanensis). Our results suggest that some stream chironomids (not typical shredders) can use leaf litter of riparian vegetation as a complementary food source.           ,              O objetivo foi avaliar o potencial uso de detritos foliares por larvas de Chironomidae. Foram realizados experimentos em campo e em laboratório utilizando folhas e larvas de Chironomidae coletadas no Brasil e em Portugal. Foram realizados experimentos em laboratório em condições controladas utilizando detritos foliares (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.,Neriumoleander L.,Protium heptaphilum (Aubl.) March,Protium brasiliense (Spreng) Engl.,Myrcia guyanensis(Aubl.) DC e Miconia chartacea Triana) após a colonização microbiana. Experimentos laboratoriais de consumo foram realizados com espécies coletadas em detritos orgânicos em riachos locais. Depois dos experimentos, quando possível, os exemplares foram deixados atingir o estágio adulto e identificados. Em Portugal foram identificadas as seguintes espécies: Micropsectra apposita (Walker, 1856),Polypedilum albicorne(Meigen, 1838),Eukiefferiella claripennis Lundbeck (1898), Rheocricotopus (Psilocricotopus) atripes Rempel (1937) e Ablabesmyia Johannsen (1905). As taxas de consumo variaram entre 0,15 ± 0,10 mg de folha animal-1 dia-1 (Micropsectra apposita alimentando-se de Alnusglutinosa) e 0,85 ± 0,33 mg de folha animal-1 dia-1 (Polypedilum albicorne alimentando-se de Miconia chartacea). No Brasil foram identificados os seguintes taxa: Phaenopsectra sp., Chironomus spp. e Polypedilum sp.; a taxa máxima de consumo foi 0,47 ± 0,28 de folha mg.animal-1 dia-1 (Chironomus Meigen (1803) alimentando-se de Protium heptaphilum). Foram igualmente feitos testes com estirpes laboratoriais de Chironomidae, algumas das quais não foram capazes de alimentarem-se de folhas em decomposição (e.g. C.xanthus Rempel (1939) em P.brasiliense e M.guyanensis). Os resultados sugerem que alguns Chironomidae (não tipicamente fragmentadores) podem utilizar detritos foliares de vegetação ripária como fonte complementar de alimento.},

Guided fractionation through autobiography on TLC using Fusarium verticillioides (Saccardo) Nirenberg as test organism led to the isolation of 1, which exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.50 mg/mL in the microbroth dilution method. Despite its own weak activity, when the coumarin was combined with the above-mentioned compounds, a strong enhancement of the antifungal effect was observed, even showing a complete inhibition in the growth of the pathogen when 1 was added at a concentration of up to 5\% of its MIC value. The same level of effectiveness was observed when the synthetic antifungal agents Mancozeb and Carboxin were each combined with compounds 1-4, in which cases it became possible to decrease the effective concentrations of these commercial compounds by up to 2.5 and 3\%, respectively. © 2005 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the key regulators of oxygen homeostasis in response to hypoxia. In diabetes, multiple tissues are hypoxic but adaptive responses to hypoxia are impaired due to insufficient activation of HIF signalling, which results from inhibition of HIF-1α stability and function due to hyperglycaemia and elevated fatty acid levels. In this review, we will summarise and discuss current findings about the regulation of HIF signalling in diabetes and the pathogenic roles of hypoxia and dysregulated HIF signalling in the development of diabetes and its complications. The therapeutic potential of targeting HIF signalling for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related complications is also discussed.}

  abstract = {Abstract For potential topical administration, we formulated a nanoemulsion containing phenolic constituents of Phyllanthus emblica branch extract.  The nanoemulsion has high entrapment efficiency, small particle size, is stable, and can release its main chemical components.  Branches of P. emblica were extracted with 50\% ethanol (EPE) with 5.4\% yield.  HPLC analysis indicated several phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, vanillic acid, epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and ellagic acid.  These were selected as chemical markers of EPE in the nanoemulsion development.  The nanoemulsion was prepared by microemulsion techniques with hot high pressure homogenization.  A ternary phase diagram was constructed to obtain the optimized nanoemulsion.  The obtained transparent EPE nanoemulsion is composed of isopropyl myristate (0.6\% w/w), Brij® 78 (0.35\% w/w), and 0.15\% (w/w) EPE.  The optimized EPE nanoemulsion had a median particle size of 191.63 ± 4.07 nm with a narrow particle size distribution, a zeta potential of -10.19 ± 0.54 mV, high entrapment efficiency at 67.99 ± 0.87\% and good stability at 4 °C after 90 d of storage.  The release of active ingredients from the EPE nanoemulsion was slower than that of the EPE aqueous formulation.  The loading ratios of the five phenolic compounds were high, with relative order of EGC {$>$} EGCG {$>$} vanillic acid {$>$} gallic acid {$>$} ellagic acid, resulting in slow release profiles of EGC and EGCG in the EPE nanoemulsion.  In conclusion, the obtained EPE nanoemulsion has good characteristics for future clinical trials.[on SciFinder (R)]},

Morinda citrifolia (Rubiaceae) is an evergreen shrub whose ripe fruit has a strong butyric acid smell and flavor. The leaves and especially the fruit are consumed in different forms by various communities (e.g., the Polynesians) throughout the world; the root is used as a dye. As a result of these uses and the market that is developing around "noni juice", it has become increasingly important to confirm the actual therapeutic properties of this plant. While recent studies have shown that this fruit has antibiotic and antioxidant properties in vitro, we still do not have scientific evidence supporting the nutritional and medicinal values of noni in humans. However, both the fruit and damnacanthal, an anthraquinone compound extracted from noni roots, are currently being studied in the context of anti-cancer research. If, in the future, the nutritional and medical values of the noni can be assessed, especially its anti-cancer activity, this fruit could play a noticeable economic role in producing countries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The one-drug/one-target/one-disease approach to drug discovery is presently facing many challenges of safety, efficacy, and sustainability. Network biology and polypharmacology approaches gained appreciation recently as methods for omics data integration and multitarget drug development, respectively. The combination of these two approaches created a novel paradigm called network pharmacology (NP) that looks at the effect of drugs on both the interactome and the diseasome level. Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, uses intelligent formulations containing multiple ingredients and multiple bioactive compounds; however, the scientific rationale and mechanisms remain largely unexplored. NP approaches can serve as a valuable tool for evidence-based Ayurveda to understand the medicines’ putative actions, indications, and mechanisms. This chapter discusses NP and its potential to explore traditional medicine systems to overcome the drug discovery impasse.}

Wehypothesize that ginsenosidesmightmediatesomeof their actions by binding to the estrogen receptor, as they share many of the protective actions of estrogen in various physi- ological systems. The present study is aimed to determine whether ginsenoside Rg1 can act like an estrogen analog in stimulating human breast cancer cell growth as well as in the activation of estrogen response element-luciferase activity in HeLa cell. Rg1, but not its aglycone, stimulates [methyl-3H] thymidine incorporation in estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 in a dose-dependentmanner(10?15–10?7M).Thestimulation of MCF-7 cell proliferation by 3 ? 10-13 M Rg1 can be blocked by 10?6 M of the estrogen antagonist ICI 182780. Moreover, Rg1 stimulates estrogen response element-luciferase reporter gene activity in HeLa cells with an optimal dose of 3 ? 10?10 M. Such stimulation can also be blocked by 10?6 M ICI 182780. In addition, Rg1 has no effect on [methyl-3H]thymidine incor- poration in estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Furthermore, Rg1 failed to displace the specific binding of [3H]17 ? -estradiol toMCF-7cell lysates,sug- gesting that no direct interaction of Rg1 with estrogen recep- tor is needed for its estrogenic action. Our results indicate that ginsenosidesRg1has estrogen-like activityandshouldbe classified as a novel class of potent phytoestrogen. (J},

In this study, we have investigated the analgesic effects of the scopoletin using the models of acetic acid-induced writhing response and the formalin test, the anti-inflammatory effects of scopoletin using model of λ -carrageenan (Carr)-induced paw edema. The treatment of ICR mice with scopoletin inhibited the numbers of writhing response and the formalin-induced pain in the late phase. This study demonstrated that the administration of scopoletin resulted in the reduction of Carr-induced mice edema, and it increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) after Carr injection. We also demonstrated scopoletin significantly attenuated the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the edema paw after Carr injection. Scopoletin decreased the NO, tumor necrosis factor (TNF- α ) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) levels on serum after Carr injection. Scopoletin decreased Carr-induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions in the edema paw. These anti-inflammatory mechanisms of scopoletin might be related to the decrease in the level of MDA via increasing the activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx in the edema paw. Also, scopoletin could affect the production of NO, TNF- α , and PGE 2 , and therefore affect the anti-inflammatory effects.}

  abstract = {Background \& aims: Although there has been some success with protein-based anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) therapeutics, the problems associated with protein-based drugs demand alternative approaches. We screened various herbal extracts for their ability to inhibit TNF-α secretions and found that BT-201, an n-butanol extract of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen (P. notoginseng) has such an ability. Methods: The purpose of this study has been to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic effects of BT-201. The anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated by measuring the effects of BT-201 on the production of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, inducible nitric oxide (iNO), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), in vitro. The anti-rheumatic effects were evaluated by treating mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) using a daily oral administration of BT-201 at 15 mg/kg/day. In addition, the effects on NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were evaluated by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies. Results: BT-201 significantly inhibited all the inflammatory parameters evaluated in vitro and delayed the onset and progression of CIA. BT-201 inhibited the activation of NF-κB, ERK, p38, and JNK pathways. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that BT-201 can modulate various aspects of inflammation in vitro and that it has disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic effects in vivo, suggesting that it can be a potential alternative to the current anti-TNF-α therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disease. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

Currently, most of the natural polyphenol products come from terrestrial sources such as tea, grape seeds among others, and few polyphenols have been developed from algae for their anti-allergic activity. The aim of the study was to screen some commercial seaweed for natural extracts with anti-allergic activity. Five algae including Laminaria japonica, Porphyra sp., Spirulina platensis, Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Scytosiphon sp. were extracted with ethanol, and the extracts were evaluated for total polyphenol contents and anti-allergic activity with the hyaluronidase inhibition assay. Results showed that the total polyphenol contents in the ethanol extracts ranged from 1.67\% to 8.47\%, while the highest was found in the extract from Scytosiphon sp. Hyaluronidase inhibition assay showed that the extracts from Scytosiphon sp. had the lowest IC50, 0.67 mg mL−1, while Chlorella pyrenoidosa extract had the highest IC50, 15.07 mg mL−1. The anti-allergic activity of Scytosiphon sp. extract was even higher than the typical anti-allergic drug Disodium Cromoglycate (DSCG) (IC50 = 1.13 mg mL−1), and was similar with natural polyphenol from Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (IC50 = 0.56 mg mL−1). These results indicated that the ethanol extract of Scytosiphon sp. contains a high concentration of polyphenol with high anti-allergic activity. Potentially Scytosiphon sp. can be developed to a natural anti-allergic compound for allergy remission.},

The CCK-8 method was used to observe the anti-proliferative effect of GRg6 on human lymphocytoma JK cells. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the influence of GRg6 on cell cycle. The Annexin-V FITC/PI double-staining method was used to detect the ratio of apoptotic cells. JC-1 staining was undertaken to observe the influence of GRg6 on intracellular mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, western blots were conducted to detect the expression level of apoptosis-related Bax and the Bcl-2 proteins. The results suggested that GRg6 can inhibit the proliferation of human lymphocytoma JK cells. GRg6 blocks an S arrest in the cell cycle. With the increase in GRg6 concentration, the potential in the cell decreased in a dose dependent manner, and Bax protein expression gradually increased, whereas Bcl-2 protein expression gradually decreased. In conclusion, GRg6 can inhibit JK cell proliferation in human lymphocytoma and induce its apoptosis. The mechanism of action may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase of Bax expression and decrease of Bcl-2 expression caused by GRg6.},

In the present study, we investigated whether PNS could promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which are implicated in BMSCs osteogenesis. We found that PNS enhanced the mRNA expression of OPG, β-catenin, and cyclin D1 while decreased the mRNA expression of RANKL and PPARγ2. The actions of PNS on BMSCs were reversed (or partially) by DKK-1, a classical inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These results suggest that PNS stimulating bone formation by promoting the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and could also protect the skeletal system by decreasing bone resorption through reduction of RANKL/OPG expression via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.}

However, the active ingredient and the mechanisms underlying the anti-osteoporosis activity of GSS have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, we determined the effect of ginsenoside Rb1, a major component of ginsenosides, on receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation. Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from Raw264.7 cells without cytotoxicity. Ginsenoside Rb1 also inhibited RANKL-induced TNFα mRNA expression in Raw264.7 cells. Pretreatment with ginsenoside Rb1 significantly inhibited RANKL-induced the gene expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1), which are two essential and crucial transcription factors for osteoclast formation. Rb1 inhibited RANKL-induced nucleus translocation and activation of NF-κB, the upstream factor of c-Fos and NFATc1. Among the three well known mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Rb1 inhibited RANKL-induced JNK and p38 phosphorylation, but not ERK1/2. Taken together, our data suggest that ginsenoside Rb1 is one of the effective components of GSS for the anti-osteoporosis activity and can inhibit osteoclastogenesis by suppressing RANKL-induced activation of both JNK and p38 MAPKs and NF-κB pathways, and consequently down-regulating the gene expression of c-Fos and NFATc1 in osteoclast precursors. © 2012.},

Oral administration of 100, 300 and 500 mg/kg of L. cubeba fruit oil significantly prolonged pentobarbitone-induced mouse sleeping time by 20.0, 110.8, and 159.6 \%, respectively. In addition, after administration of L. cubeba oil, mice significantly increased the time spent in the open arms and number of entries into the open arms of an elevated plus maze compared to saline-treated mice suggesting that L. cubeba oil has anxiolytic activity. A tail-flick test conducted after treatment of mice with 500 mg/kg L. cubeba fruit oil also suggested that this oil has potent analgetic activity. According to GC/MS analyses, the essential fruit oil of L. cubeba oil consists of 23 compounds. The main components are geranial (37.16 \%), neral (28.29 \%), and d-limonene (22.90 \%). We conclude that L. cubeba oil has a potent effect on the central nervous system of mice.},

Evidences demonstrated that PNS could protect cardiomyocytes from injury induced by ischemia, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this protective effect are still unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the protective effect and potential molecular mechanisms of PNS on apoptosis in H9c2 cells in vitro and rat myocardial ischemia injury model in vivo.  MATERIALS AND METHODS H9c2 cells subjected to serum, glucose and oxygen deprivation (SGOD) were used as in vitro models and SD rats subjected to left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation were used as in vivo models. The anti-apoptotic effect of PNS was evaluated by Annexin V/PI analysis or TUNEL assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was detected by JC-1 analysis. The expression of Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were detected by western blot assay.  RESULTS PNS exhibited anti-apoptotic effect both in H9c2 cells and in ischemic myocardial tissues. However, the effect was blocked in vitro by LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor. The anti-apoptotic effect of PNS was mediated by stabilizing Δψm in H9c2 cells. Furthermore the indices of the left ventricular ejection fractions (EF), left ventricular fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular dimensions at end diastole (LVDd) and left ventricular dimensions at end systole (LVDs) suggested that PNS improved rats cardiac function. PNS significantly increased p-Akt both in H9c2 cells and in ischemic myocardial tissues and this effect was also blocked by LY294002 in H9c2 cells.  CONCLUSION Results of this study suggested that PNS could protect myocardial cells from apoptosis induced by ischemia in both the in vitro and in vivo models through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.}

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) were extracted from the root of the plant. This is the first study on anti-hyperglycemic and anti-obese effects of PNS in genetic model mice. Additionally, the preventive effect on diabetic nephropathy was investigated. Animals received intraperitoneal injections of PNS 50 or 200 mg/kg daily. On day 12, 22 and 30, PNS-treated groups had significantly lower fasting blood glucose levels and smaller body weight incremental percentage. After a 12-day treatment, glucose tolerance of PNS groups were significantly improved; these indices in PNS-treated mice exhibited a dose-dependent improvement. Furthermore, on day 30, the serum insulin resistance index and triglyceride levels of PNS-treated groups decreased significantly, and the development of the mice glomerular lesions was prevented significantly. The results in this present paper indicate that PNS possesses anti-diabetes and anti-obese activities and may prove to be of clinical importance in improving the management of type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {The complexation between soy soluble polysaccharide (SSPS) and curcumin at pH 7.0 and 4.0, as well as some physicochemical characteristics of the resultant complexes, was investigated. The encapsulation efficiency and loading amount of curcumin in the complexes at pH 4.0 reached 67.3\% and 4.49 μg/mg SSPS, respectively. Ethanol-induced denaturation and structural unfolding of the protein fraction in SSPS was essential for complex formation. The complexation with curcumin resulted in aggregation of SSPS and the subsequent formation of compacted nanoparticles with curcumin as the core. The complexation greatly improved the heat stability and in vitro bioaccessibility of curcumin. In general, the encapsulation efficiency, heat stability, and bioaccessibility of curcumin in the complexes at pH 4.0 were better than those at pH 7.0. The findings are of importance for the development of food grade nanovehicles for enhanced water solubility, stability, and bioaccessibility of hydrophobic bioactives.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether total Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) could protect endothelium of rabbit iliac artery against balloon endothelial denudation (BED) injury. METHODS: The morphology changes of the endothelium were observed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and hematoxylin and eosin stain after BED of rabbit iliac artery at 0, 4, 6, and 8 week respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was also determined by immunohistochemistry. PNS 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg were administered iv per day from 2 d before to 4 weeks after operation. RESULTS: The endothelium was denudated completely after BED. At the 4th week the endothelium was repaired in some degree, then recovered gradually at 6 and 8 week. The degree of intimal thickening at 4 week was significantly greater than that at 0, 6, or 8 week. The sequence of VEGF or MMP-2 staining from strong to weak was 4, 6, 0, 8 week, and normal control. However at 4 week, endothelial regeneration in PNS 30 and 50 mg/kg groups was significantly faster than that in saline group. The intimal thickness was significantly decreased and expressions of VEGF and MMP-2 were both down-regulated in PNS 30 or 50 mg/kg groups compared with saline control group. CONCLUSION: PNS promoted the endothelial regeneration and reduced ECM thickening, which was related to regulation of the expression of VEGF and MMP-2. PNS may have sustained antirestenotic effect after BED.},

  abstract = {Securinega alkaloids represent a family of plant secondary metabolites known for 50. years. Securinine (. 1), the most abundant and studied alkaloid of this series was isolated by Russian researchers in 1956. In the following years, French and Japanese scientists reported other Securinega compounds and extensive work was done to elucidate their intriguing structures. The homogeneity of this family relies mainly on its tetracyclic chemical backbone, which features a butenolide moiety (cycle D) and an azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane ring system (rings B and C). Interestingly, after a period of latency of 20. years, the Securinega topic reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures and to date more than 50 compounds have been identified and characterized. The oligomeric subgroup gathering dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric units is of particular interest. The unprecedented structure of the Securinega alkaloids was the subject of extensive synthetic efforts culminating in several efficient and elegant total syntheses. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids seems limited to the Securinega, Flueggea, Margaritaria, and Breynia genera (Phyllanthaceae). However, only a limited number of plant species have been considered for their alkaloid contents, and additional phytochemical as well as genetic studies are needed. Concerning the biosynthesis, experiments carried out with radiolabelled aminoacids allowed to identify lysine and tyrosine as the precursors of the piperidine ring A and the CD rings of securinine (. 1), respectively. Besides, plausible biosynthetic pathways were proposed for virosaine A (. 38) and B (. 39), flueggine A (. 46), and also the different oligomers flueggenine A-D (. 48-. 51), fluevirosinine A (. 56), and flueggedine (. 20). The case of nirurine (. 45) and secu'amamine (. 37) remains elusive and additional studies seem necessary to understand their mode of production. The scope of biological of activities of the Securinega alkaloids was mainly centered on the CNS activity of securinine (. 1), although the exact mechanism of action remained in part unknown. Nevertheless, for its stimulant and antispasmodic effects securinine nitrate was marketed as a drug in the USSR until the early 1990s. Moreover, securinine (. 1) and several other Securinega alkaloids recently demonstrated promising anticancer properties. In particular securinine (. 1) demonstrated markedly benefits in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.},

Sixty-three healthy postmenopausal women were randomized to inhale 0.1\% or 0.5\% neroli oil or almond oil (control) for 5 minutes twice daily for 5 days. Menopause-related symptoms, as determined by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL); sexual desire visual analog scale (VAS); serum cortisol and estrogen concentrations, blood pressure, pulse, and stress VAS, were measured before and after inhalation. Compared with the control group, the two neroli oil groups showed significant improvements in the physical domain score of the MENQOL and in sexual desire. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the group inhaling 0.5\% neroli oil than in the control group. Compared with the control group, the two neroli oil groups showed significantly lower diastolic blood pressure and tended to improve pulse rate and serum cortisol and estrogen concentrations. These findings indicate that inhalation of neroli oil helps relieve menopausal symptoms, increase sexual desire, and reduce blood pressure in postmenopausal women. Neroli oil may have potential as an effective intervention to reduce stress and improve the endocrine system.},

  abstract = {A Radix Notoginseng flavonol glycoside (RNFG), quercetin 3-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, was isolated from roots of Panax notoginseng. Among different biological properties tested, RNFG possessed a strong activity in preventing amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced cell death. In an in vitro assay, RNFG inhibited the aggregation of Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, application of RNFG in cultured cortical neurons, or PC12 cells, reduced the Aβ-induced cell death in time- and dose-dependent manners, with the suppression of Aβ-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. In cultured neurons, the pre-treatment of RNFG abolished the increase of Ca2+ mobilization triggered by Aβ. The neuroprotective properties of RNFG required a specific sugar attachment within the main chemical backbone because the flavonol backbone by itself did not show any protective effect. In memory impairment experiments using the passive avoidance task, the administration of RNFG reduced brain damage in scopolamine-treated rats. These results therefore reveal a novel function of Radix Notoginseng and its flavonol glycoside that could be very useful in developing food supplements for the prevention, or potential treatment, of Alzheimer's disease. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.}

By contrast, the inducing activities of 12 soy isoflavones both on quinone reductase in HepG2 cells and proliferation of the osteoblastic MG-63 cells demonstrated significant correlation to the hydroxyl and methoxyl substituents on the isoflavone skeleton (p{$<$}0.01).},

Our aim was to evaluate their effect on fibrinogen and lipid plasma levels compared with a well-known HMGCoA reductase inhibitor. Seventy Wistar male adult rats on a fat-enriched diet were treated orally with P. notoginseng pulverized root (43 mg/kg/day or 86 mg/kg/day; 20 animals per group), fluvastatin (3 mg/kg/day; 20 animals) or physiological saline (5 mL/kg/day; 10 animals). The ten rats on a normocaloric diet were also treated with 5 mL/kg/day of physiological saline. After a 28-day treatment, the rats were killed and their blood analysed with standard procedures. Treatment with 43 mg/kg/day of P. notoginseng or 3 mg/kg/day of fluvastatin showed similar activity in decreasing total cholesterol (-23.70\%, -19.29\%, respectively) and triglycerides (-21.59\%, -18.55\%). The most evident effect of P. notoginseng was the reduction of fibrinogenaemia in treated rats compared with the control values (-38.10\%; p {$<$} 0.001), no dose-relationship being shown in this effect. Moreover, no significant variation in HDL cholesterol and glucose levels was observed nor did relevant behavioural changes occur in association with the root intake. Besides a moderate, non dose-related decrease in the plasma lipid levels, P. notoginseng appeared to induce a significant reduction in the rat fibrinogenaemia.},

Experimental data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations, with normal distribution and the identity link function. From the spectral information from the tested essential oils, we worked their molecular modeling as mixtures by developing mixture descriptors ( Dmix) that combined the molecular descriptor of each component in the mixture ( d i) and its relative concentration ( x i), i.e., Dmix = f( d i, x i). The application of chemoinformatic approaches determined that a combination of mixture descriptors related to molecular size, branchedness, charge distribution, and electronegativity were useful to explain the bioactivity profile against Carpophilus spp. and Oryzaephilus spp. The reported models were rigorously validated using stringent statistical parameters and essential oils reported with repellent activity against other beetle species from the Nitidulidae and Silvanidae families. This model confirmed each essential oil as a repellent with a comparable performance to the experimental reports.},

Results               We structured the data model for cognate ligand binding site annotations in UniProtKB and performed a complete reannotation of all cognate ligand binding sites using stable unique identifiers from ChEBI, which we now use as the reference vocabulary for all such annotations. We developed improved search and query facilities for cognate ligands in the UniProt website, REST API and SPARQL endpoint that leverage the chemical structure data, nomenclature and classification that ChEBI provides.                                         Availability and implementation               Binding site annotations for cognate ligands described using ChEBI are available for UniProtKB protein sequence records in several formats (text, XML and RDF) and are freely available to query and download through the UniProt website (www.uniprot.org), REST API (www.uniprot.org/help/api), SPARQL endpoint (sparql.uniprot.org/) and FTP site (https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/).

  abstract = {Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the most common head and neck cancer. Astragali radix extracts play crucial roles in the regulation of cancer progression. However, the role of Astragali radix extracts in LSCC and the related mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of the combined use of Astragali radix total flavonoid (TFA) and cisplatin (CDDP) on an LSCC mouse model by pharmacodynamics. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was employed to define the prototype of TFA in vivo. The potential drug targets were identified through the integrative analysis of LSCC microarrays, RNA sequencing data and the main bioactive component of TFA. Furthermore, a protein–protein interaction network, compound–target network and target–pathway network were constructed based on the prototype and potential drug targets to identify the main targets and pathways. Animal experiments showed that TFA has significant synergistic antitumor activity with cisplatin and attenuates the nephrotoxicity caused by CDDP chemotherapy, improving the survival of LSCC-bearing mice. Using UPLC-MS/MS, we identified 8 constituents of TFA in experimental mice serum: formononetin, ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan, 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavaneglucoside, 3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan and 9,10-dimethoxyptercarpan-3-O-β-D-glucoside. Integrative analysis predicted 19 target genes for TFA constituents, and the target genes were mainly involved in the EGFR-related cancer signaling, metabolism and oxidative stress. Collectively, these findings highlight the role of TFA in the regulation of LSCC and provide potential targets for a high-efficiency and low-toxicity therapeutic strategy of LSCC.}

Predictions are based on the similarity principle, through reverse screening. Here, we describe the 2019 version, which represents a major update in terms of underlying data, backend and web interface. The bioactivity data were updated, the model retrained and similarity thresholds redefined. In the new version, the predictions are performed by searching for similar molecules, in 2D and 3D, within a larger collection of 376 342 compounds known to be experimentally active on an extended set of 3068 macromolecular targets. An efficient backend implementation allows to speed up the process that returns results for a druglike molecule on human proteins in 15–20 s. The refreshed web interface enhances user experience with new features for easy input and improved analysis. Interoperability capacity enables straightforward submission of any input or output molecule to other on-line computer-aided drug design tools, developed by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. High levels of predictive performance were maintained despite more extended biological and chemical spaces to be explored, e.g. achieving at least one correct human target in the top 15 predictions for \&gt;70\% of external compounds. The new SwissTargetPrediction is available free of charge (www.swisstargetprediction.ch).}

  abstract = {Lippia alba is a flowering shrub in the verbena family and its essential oil (EO) is known for its sedative, antidepressant and analgesic properties. In the Amazon region of Brazil, it is used in aquaculture to anesthetize fish during transport. Many of the specialized metabolites found in EOs presumably evolved to protect plants from herbivores, especially insects. We used Drosophila to test the behavioral and physiological actions of this EO and its components. We found that 150 min exposure to the EO vapors resulted in immobilization of adult flies. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified the major components of the EO as the monoterpenes: citral (59\%), carvone (7\%) and limonene (7\%). Fly immobilization by the EO was due to citral and carvone with citral producing more rapid effects than carvone. We tested whether the EO affected synaptic physiology by applying it to the larval neuromuscular junction. The EO delivered at 0.012\% (v/v) produced over a 50\% reduction in EPSP amplitude within 3-4 min. When the EO components were applied at 0.4 mM, citral and carvone produced a significant reduction in EPSP amplitude with citral producing the largest effect. Measurement of miniature EPSP amplitudes demonstrated that citral produced over a 50\% reduction in transmitter release. Ca-imaging experiments showed that citral produced about 30\% reduction in presynaptic Ca influx, which likely resulted in the decrease in transmitter release. Thus, the EO blocks synaptic transmission, largely due to citral, and this likely contributes to its behavioral effects.},

  abstract = {Methylglyoxal is formed in vivo by spontaneous decomposition of triose phosphate intermediates in aerobic glycolysis. It may also be formed during oxidative degradation of both carbohydrates (pentoses and ascorbate) and lipids (arachidonate). In addition to reaction with arginine residues to form imidazolone adducts, methylglyoxal reacts with lysine residues in protein to form N(epsilon)-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) and the imidazolium crosslink, methylglyoxal-lysine dimer (MOLD). Like the glycoxidation products, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and glyoxal-lysine dimer (GOLD) which are formed on reaction of glyoxal with protein, CEL and MOLD increase in lens proteins and skin collagen with age. CML and CEL also increase in skin collagen in diabetes, while all four compounds increase in plasma proteins in uremia. Overall, CML, CEL, GOLD and MOLD are quantitatively the major biomarkers of the Maillard reaction in tissue proteins. GOLD and MOLD, in particular, are present at 10-50 fold higher concentrations than the fluorescent crosslink, pentosidine. Together, these dicarbonyl-derived advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) represent the major chemical modifications that accumulate in tissue proteins with age and in chronic diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis.}

Electronic transition energies and rotational strengths of these eight eremophilane lactones and two petasins were calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (B3PW91/TZVP). The absolute configurations of the constituents could be assigned by comparison of their simulated and experimental circular dichroism (CD) spectra in methanol as (4S,5R,8S,10R) (1, 2), (2R,4S,5R,8S,10R) (3, 4, 5), (2R,4S,5R,8R,9R,10R) (6), (2R,4S,5R,8R,10R) (7, 8), and (3R,4R,5R) (9, 10). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 8beta-hydroxyeremophilanolide ((8S)-8-hydroxyeremophil-7(11)-en-12,8-olide) (1) served as starting point for the theoretical conformational calculations of the 8beta-epimers of the eremophilane lactones. Experimental CD spectra as well as (1)H NMR spectra of compound 1 in methanol were considerably dependent on sample concentration.},

Since the original formulation of these functions contains non-differentiable points, only search methods can be used to optimize the overall desirability response. Furthermore, all responses are treated as equally important. We present modified desirability functions that are everywhere differentiable so that more efficient gradient-based optimization methods can be used instead. The proposed functions have the extra flexibility of allowing the analyst to assign different priorities among the responses. The methodology is applied to a wire bonding process that occurs in semiconductor manufacturing, an industrial process where multiple responses are common.},

Independent of the granulation technique, technologically developed granules presented particle diameter, bulk and tapped densities and compressibility indexes suitable for a solid dosage form. The compression behavior showed plastic and fragmentary deformation for granules produced by the dry granulation technique and predominantly plastic deformation for wet granulation. Concerning the humidity sorption, the study showed that granules absorb less humidity than the spray-dried extract. However, granules with Eudragit® E 100 were the least hygroscopic.},

Sesquiterpene lactones are a recognized class of terpenoids with a wide spectrum of biological activities, including activity against Leishmania spp. In this work, a sesquiterpene lactone-rich preparation-a leaf rinse extract (LRE) from Tithonia diversifolia-was tested against promastigote forms of L. braziliensis. The results revealed that the LRE is a rich source of potent leishmanicidal compounds, with an LD50 value 1.5 ± 0.50 µg·mL-1. Therefore, eight sesquiterpene lactones from the LRE were initially investigated against promastigote forms of L. braziliensis. One of them did not present any significant leishmanicidal effect (LD50 {$>$} 50 µg·mL-1). Another had a cytotoxic effect against macrophages (4.5 µg·mL-1). The five leishmanicidal compounds with the highest level of selectivity were further evaluated against intracellular parasites (amastigotes) using peritoneal macrophages. Tirotundin 3-O-methyl ether, tagitinin F, and a guaianolide reduced the internalization of parasites after 48 h, in comparison with the negative control. This is the first report on sesquiterpene lactones that have potent leishmanicidal effects on both developmental stages of L. braziliensis.},

Bacopa monniera is described in the Ayurvedic Materia Medica, as a therapeutically useful herb for the treatment of cognitive impairment, thus supporting its possible anti-Alzheimer's properties. Our studies have shown that Bacopa monniera reduces beta-amyloid deposits in the brain of an Alzheimer's disease animal model. The objective of this study was to establish the presence of endogenous substances in Bacopa monniera extract (BmE) that will impact components of the oxidative stress cascade such as the reduction of divalent metals, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, alterations of lipoxygenase activity and hydrogen peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation. The extract contained polyphenols and sulfhydryl contents suggestive of endogenous antioxidant activity. The results demonstrated that BmE reduced divalent metals, dose-dependently scavenged reactive oxygen species, decreased the formation of lipid peroxides and inhibited lipoxygenase activity. These data combined with our previous studies that have shown that BmE treatment reduces beta-amyloid levels in the brain of an Alzheimer's disease doubly transgenic mouse model of rapid amyloid deposition (PSAPP mice) suggesting mechanisms of action relevant to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.},

(Scrophulariaceae), namely angoroside A (1), angoroside C (2), angoroside D (3), acteoside (4) and isoacteoside (5), had been evaluated as potential inhibitors of some macrophage functions involved in the inflammatory process. These compounds have been tested in two experimental systems: ionophore-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages and human platelets serve as source of COX-1 and 5-LOX, and mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with E. coli LPS are the means of testing for COX-2, NO and TNF-α activity. None of compounds assayed had a significant effect on LTC4-release from calcium ionophore-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages. However, the release of PGE2by mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with calcium ionophore was inhibited by most of these compounds. In the TXB2-release assay, acteoside (4), angoroside A (1) and angoroside C (2) showed a significant effect. These five compounds, except angoroside C (2) significantly inhibited LPS-induced PGE2, NO and TNF-α in a concentration-dependent manner. In LPS-stimulated macrophages, the phenylpropanoid glycoside angoroside C (2) only had activity on NO. These results indicate that the pharmacology of these compounds may participate in the anti-inflammatory effect of Scrophularia scorodonia. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The present study determined the anti-inflammatory activity and related mechanisms of scopoletin. It was found that scopoletin significantly inhibited croton oil-induced mouse ear edema. Scopoletin could also decrease the vascular dye leakage induced by topical application of croton oil, consistent with the reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and polymorphonuclear (PMN) infiltration. The inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase l-N ω -nitro-arginine (l-NN, 10 mg/kg) attenuated croton oil-induced ear edema by 56.5\%. However, pretreatment of l-NN did not affect the inhibitory effects of scopoletin (100 mg/kg) on mouse ear edema, which suggested that scopoletin exerted anti-inflammatory activities in an endothelial NO-independent manner. Further research revealed that scopoletin reduced the overproduction of PGE2 and TNF-α± in croton oil-treated mouse ears. Scopoletin was also shown to attenuate the hind paw edema induced by carrageenan in mice, and lower the MPO activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in paw tissues. These findings imply that the anti-inflammatory activities of scopoletin involve inhibition of eicosanoid biosynthesis, cell influx, and peroxidation. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.},

For exploring the involved mechanisms of action of scopoletin, potential inhibitory effects on xanthine oxidase and possible uricosuric effects were investigated. Scopoletin (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the activity of xanthine oxidase in liver homogenates of hyperuricemic mice although it only showed a relatively weak, albeit competitive-type, inhibition of xanthine oxidase in a commercial assay. Furthermore, a potent uricosuric effect of scopoletin (100, 200 mg/kg) was ascertained. These results demonstrated for the first time that scopoletin exhibits, hypouricemic activities through decreasing uric acid production and as well as a uricosuric mechanism.}

This study aimed to investigate associations between MAOA and MAOB polymorphisms and personality traits of positive and negative emotionality in healthy volunteers, to elucidate mechanisms underlying personality and the risk for depression. Healthy Caucasian volunteers (N = 150) completed the Multiphasic Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), which includes independent superfactors of Positive Emotionality and Negative Emotionality. Participants were genotyped for 8 MAOA and 12 MAOB single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Association analyses for both SNPs and haplotypes were performed using the permutation approach implemented in PLINK. Negative Emotionality was significantly associated with the two highly linked MAOB polymorphisms rs10521432 and rs6651806 (p {$<$} 0.002). Findings were extended in haplotype analyses. For MAOB the 4-SNP haplotype GACG formed from rs1799836, rs10521432, rs6651806 and rs590551 was significantly related to lower Negative Emotionality scores (p {$<$} 0.002). MAOA was not related to personality in this study. Our finding provides the first evidence that MAOB polymorphisms influence levels of negative emotionality in healthy human volunteers. If confirmed, these results could lead to a better understanding of personality traits and inter-individual susceptibility developing psychiatric disorders such as major depression.},

The disease is characterized by initial hyperinsulinemia, progressing to hypoinsulinemia associated with depleted pancreatic insulin stores. The contribution of changes in β-cell turnover to insulin deficiency was investigated in vivo during transition to overt diabetes. Normo glycemic diabetes-prone P. obesus animals who were given a high-calorie diet developed hyperglycemia within 4 days, which was found to be associated with a progressive decline in pancreatic insulin content. This was accompanied by a transient increase in β-cell proliferative activity and by a prolonged increase in the rate of β-cell death, culminating in disruption of islet architecture. The hypothesis that 'glucotoxicity' was responsible for these in vivo changes was investigated in vitro in primary islet cultures. Exposure of islets from diabetes-prone P. obesus to high glucose levels resulted in a dose-dependent increase in β-cell DNA fragmentation. In contrast, high glucose levels did not induce DNA fragmentation in rat islets, whereas islets from a diabetes-resistant P. obesus line exhibited a reduced and delayed response. Aminoguanidine did not prevent glucose-induced β-cell DNA fragmentation in vitro, suggesting that formation of nitric oxide and/or advanced glycation end products plays no major role. Elevated glucose concentrations stimulated β-cell proliferation in both rat and P. obesus islets. However, unlike the marked long-lasting effect in rat islets, only a transient and reduced proliferative response was observed in P. obesus islets; furthermore, β-cell proliferation was inhibited after prolonged exposure to elevated glucose levels. These results suggest that hyperglycemia-induced β-cell death coupled with reduced proliferative capacity may contribute to the insulin deficiency and deterioration of glucose homeostasis in P. obesus. Similar adverse effects of hyperglycemia could play a role in the evolution of type 2 diabetes in genetically susceptible individuals.}

  abstract = {Current pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D) is a high-risk investment which is usually faced with some unexpected even disastrous failures in different stages of drug discovery. One main reason for R\&D failures is the efficacy and safety deficiencies which are related largely to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties and various toxicities (T). Therefore, rapid ADMET evaluation is urgently needed to minimize failures in the drug discovery process. Here, we developed a web-based platform called ADMETlab for systematic ADMET evaluation of chemicals based on a comprehensively collected ADMET database consisting of 288,967 entries. Four function modules in the platform enable users to conveniently perform six types of drug-likeness analysis (five rules and one prediction model), 31 ADMET endpoints prediction (basic property: 3, absorption: 6, distribution: 3, metabolism: 10, elimination: 2, toxicity: 7), systematic evaluation and database/similarity searching. We believe that this web platform will hopefully facilitate the drug discovery process by enabling early drug-likeness evaluation, rapid ADMET virtual screening or filtering and prioritization of chemical structures. The ADMETlab web platform is designed based on the Django framework in Python, and is freely accessible at http://admet.scbdd.com/.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) extracted from the roots of panax notoginseng are free radical-scavenger, with an antioxidant property, capable of inhibiting expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines. This study was designed to test the effects of PNS administration in apolipoprotein (apo)-E-deficient mice on the activation of JNK, p38(MAPK), ERK1/2 and NF-κB, and the expression of RAGE, adhesion molecules and chemokines in the atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS Wild type and apoE-null mice (male, 10-week-old) were treated with PNS for 4 weeks. Peripheral blood was collected for assessing the serum levels of glucose, lipids and MDA, and activities of SOD and GSH. The sizes of atherosclerotic lesions and numbers of macrophages in the branchiocephalic arteries, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the aortic root were analyzed. The levels of CD68, Galectin-3, RAGE, JNK, phosphor-JNK, p38(MAPK), phosphor-p38(MAPK), ERK1/2, phosphor-ERK1/2, I-κB, phosphor-I-κB (Ser32), NF-κB, phosphor-NF-κB, MCP-1, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in the descending arteries were identified by Western blot. RESULTS The atherosclerotic lesion sizes, and macrophage numbers, but not the smooth muscle cell amounts and the collagen content, were decreased in apoE(-/-) mice treated with PNS. After PNS administration for 4 weeks, the apoE(-/-) mice displayed reduced level of serum MDA and enhanced activity of SOD and GSH, accompanied by impaired ROS generation in the aortic root. Moreover, PNS down-regulated the expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and MCP-1, accompanied by reduced expression of RAGE and suppressed the activation of NF-κB, JNK, p38(MAPK) and ERK1/2. CONCLUSION PNS may inhibit progression of atherosclerotic lesions via their antioxidant/anti-inflammatory biological properties. PNS suppress the RAGE/MAPK signaling pathways, inactivate NF-κB, and reduce expression of pro-inflammatory factors, such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE(-/-) mice.},

Pre-clinical work has also identified a number of acute anxiolytic, nootropic, and cardiovascular effects of BM. There has, however, been little research on the acute effects of BM on cognitive function. The current study aimed to assess the acute effects of a specific extract of BM (KeenMind®-CDRI 08) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in normal healthy participants who completed a cognitively demanding series of tests. Twenty-four healthy volunteers completed six repetitions of the Cognitive Demand Battery (CDB) after consuming a placebo, 320 mg BM or 640 mg of BM in a cross-over design and provided cardiovascular and mood assessments before and after treatment. Change from baseline scores indicated that the 320 mg dose of BM improved performance at the first, second, and fourth repetition post-dosing on the CDB, and the treatments had no effect upon cardiovascular activity or in attenuating task-induced ratings of stress and fatigue. It was concluded that assessment of an earlier pharmacological window and use of less memory-specific cognitive tests together with more temporally sensitive measures of brain activity may improve our understanding of the acute neurocognitive properties of BM.},

We intended to explain the molecular mechanism of this effect. Therefore, the combined methods of reverse molecular docking and network pharmacology were used in order to illuminate the molecular mechanisms for Avicularin against cancer. Materials and Methods: Potential targets associated with anti-tumor effects of Avicularin were screened by reverse molecular docking, then a protein database was established through constructing the drugprotein network from literature mining data, and the protein-protein network was built through an in-depth exploration of the relationships between the proteins, and then the network topology analysis was performed. Additionally, gene function and signaling pathways were analyzed by Go bio-enrichment and KEGG Pathway. Results: The result showed that Avicularin was closely related to 16 targets associated with cancer, and it may significantly influence the pro-survival signals in MAPK signaling pathway that can activate and regulate a series of cellular activities and participate in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, transformation and apoptosis. Conclusion: The network pharmacology strategy used herein provided a powerful means for the mechanisms of action for bioactive ingredients.}

If local ecological knowledge can be integrated into the development of indicator species, then improvements in both the rigor of the indicator list and the involvement of local people in the monitoring process may occur. We used a dual methodology to derive two forest condition indicator species lists using trees, based on local ecological knowledge and quantitative forest surveys. Combining these lists allowed us to produce a final list of thirteen 'probable' and eight 'possible' indicator tree species for forest condition monitoring. Despite some possible limitations to the methodology, we encourage the use of multiple data sets when working with rural communities that are involved in the monitoring process. Local people can propose timely and appropriate measures of forest conservation and improvement, and can definitely integrate indicator species into monitoring community forests. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations. There are no effective therapies to prevent diabetic ulcer formation and only modestly effective technologies to help with their healing. To enhance diabetic wound healing we designed a transdermal delivery system containing the FDA-approved small molecule deferoxamine, an iron chelator that increases defective hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha transactivation in diabetes by preventing iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen stress. This system overcomes the challenge of delivering hydrophilic molecules through the normally impermeable stratum corneum and both prevents diabetic ulcer formation and improves the healing of existing diabetic wounds. This represents a prophylactic pharmacological agent to prevent ulcer formation that is rapidly translatable into the clinic and has the potential to ultimately transform the care and prevention of diabetic complications., There is a high mortality in patients with diabetes and severe pressure ulcers. For example, chronic pressure sores of the heels often lead to limb loss in diabetic patients. A major factor underlying this is reduced neovascularization caused by impaired activity of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α). In diabetes, HIF-1α function is compromised by a high glucose-induced and reactive oxygen species-mediated modification of its coactivator p300, leading to impaired HIF-1α transactivation. We examined whether local enhancement of HIF-1α activity would improve diabetic wound healing and minimize the severity of diabetic ulcers. To improve HIF-1α activity we designed a transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) containing the FDA-approved small molecule deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator that increases HIF-1α transactivation in diabetes by preventing iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen stress. Applying this TDDS to a pressure-induced ulcer model in diabetic mice, we found that transdermal delivery of DFO significantly improved wound healing. Unexpectedly, prophylactic application of this transdermal delivery system also prevented diabetic ulcer formation. DFO-treated wounds demonstrated increased collagen density, improved neovascularization, and reduction of free radical formation, leading to decreased cell death. These findings suggest that transdermal delivery of DFO provides a targeted means to both prevent ulcer formation and accelerate diabetic wound healing with the potential for rapid clinical translation.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity have been reported in diabetes mellitus. Glibenclamide (glyburide), a member of the second-generation sulphonylureas, provides effective treatment for patients with moderate diabetes. The action of the liver plays an important role in its glucose-lowering effect, suggesting that glibenclamide also exerts a direct effect on liver enzyme activities. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of glibenclamide on the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD) in liver and kidney tissue of diabetic rats. METHODS: Thirty-nine rats were included in this study. Moderate diabetes mellitus was induced with streptozocin (freshly dissolved in citrate buffer, ph 4.5) 55 mg/kg in 22 rats. Eight of these diabetic rats were left untreated, insulin was administered to six diabetic rats, and glibenclamide was administered to eight rats with moderate diabetes. Liver and kidney CAT and SOD activities were measured in all rats. RESULTS: Hepatic CAT and SOD activities were significantly reduced in diabetic animals (p {$<$} 0.05 for both activities). Glibenclamide treatment of diabetic rats for 5 weeks reversed the changes observed in diabetic liver tissues (p {$<$} 0.05). However, renal CAT and SOD activities were unchanged. In addition, high blood glucose levels of diabetic rats were decreased following glibenclamide treatment. CONCLUSION: Administration of glibenclamide to diabetic rats reversed diabetes-induced changes, suggesting that glibenclamide may directly increase liver CAT and SOD activity.}

These endothelial alterations contribute to excess cardiovascular disease in diabetes, but may also play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, especially type 2. The mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in diabetes differ between type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D): hyperglycemia contributes to endothelial dysfunction in all individuals with diabetes, whereas the causative mechanisms in T2D also include impaired insulin signaling in endothelial cells, dyslipidemia and altered secretion of bioactive substances (adipokines) by adipose tissue. The close association of so-called perivascular adipose tissue with arteries and arterioles facilitates the exposure of vascular endothelium to adipokines, particularly if inflammation activates the adipose tissue. Glucose and adipokines activate specific intracellular signaling pathways in endothelium, which in concert result in endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Here, we review the characteristics of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, the causative mechanisms involved and the role of endothelial dysfunction(s) in the pathogenesis of T2D. Finally, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of endothelial dysfunction in T2D.},

Despite having been rediscovered nearly a decade ago, very little is known of the critically endangered cao vit gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) or its habitat. We analysed forest cover, made direct observations and conducted interviews of local elders to better understand forest changes and to determine the forest characters and species important to the survival of the gibbon. Interviews indicated human-induced forest resource exploitation focused on species-specific and larger trees most easily accessed. Gibbon forest habitat comprised four primary forest types. The mean canopy height over the whole site was 10.52. m. Gibbons consumed 81, or nearly half of the tree and liana species recorded in the site; however, only 19 species provide 77.8\% of the diet. Six of the 19 food species were logged for different reasons throughout the history of the site. We conclude that effective conservation management of primates with highly limited distributions, focused dietary needs, and in degraded ecosystems will require active forest restoration, such as planting important food species in degraded sites. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Chen has been used as a health product and natural remedy in traditional medicine for cardiovascular diseases for more than 1000 years in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are the major effective ingredients extracted from Panax notoginseng.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nAIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) attenuated atherosclerosis by inducing liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the effects.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The AS rats were treated once daily with PNS (100 mg/kg, i.p.), and pathological changes in the aorta were observed using Sudan IV staining. The expression of LXRα in the aortic wall was measured by Western blot analysis. THP-1 macrophages were cultured with PNS in the presence or absence of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt (GGPP), an LXRα antagonist. The expression of LXRα and its target genes ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1 (ABCA1, ABCG1) were determined by qRT-PCR. The transcriptional activation of the LXRα gene promoter was analyzed by a reporter assay. The NF-κB DNA binding activity and the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) was evaluated respectively by Trans-AM NF-κB ELISA and ELISA in THP-1 macrophages that were stimulated with LPS after treatment with PNS and GGPP.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: PNS treatment alleviated the typical pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis in rats. The expression of LXRα was increased in rat aortas after treatment with PNS. In vitro, PNS increased LXRα mRNA levels in THP-1 macrophages. The reporter assays showed that PNS enhanced transcriptional activation of the LXRα gene promoter and led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. This upregulation could be reversed by treatment with GGPP. Additionally, PNS inhibited NF-κB DNA binding activity and reduced secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. These effects could be reversed by GGPP.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the PNS-mediated attenuation of AS may, at least partly, due to LXRα uprergulation. The mechanisms of action included enhancement transcriptional activation of the LXRα gene promoter by PNS and subsequent upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity.},

P. amarus (250 and 500 mg/kg/day) and ethanol (5 g/kg/day, 20\% w/v) were administered orally to animals for 4 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively. Ethanol treatment markedly decreased the level of reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the liver, which were significantly enhanced by P. amarus treatment. Glutathione-S transferase (GST), which was increased after chronic ethanol administration, was significantly reduced by P. amarus treatment in the liver. Also, P. amarus significantly increased the activities of hepatic alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), with a concomitant marked reduction in the plasma activity of the transaminases in the ethanol-challenged rats. Lipid peroxidation level, which was increased after chronic ethanol administration, was significantly reduced in the liver by P. amarus co-treatment. Results show that P. amarus leaf extract could protect the liver against ethanol-induced oxidative damage by possibly reducing the rate of lipid peroxidation and increasing the antioxidant defence mechanism in rats. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications of these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, of which distal symmetric polyneuropathy (for the purpose of this Primer, referred to as diabetic neuropathy) is very common. Diabetic neuropathy is a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities that is also characterized by pain and substantial morbidity. Over time, at least 50\% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose control effectively halts the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have led to new efforts to understand the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy, along with new 2017 recommendations on approaches to prevent and treat this disorder that are specific for each type of diabetes. In parallel, new guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy using distinct classes of drugs, with an emphasis on avoiding opioid use, have been issued. Although our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remains unknown. Future discoveries on disease pathogenesis will be crucial to successfully address all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, from prevention to treatment.}

We used the Delphi consensus method to determine dementia prevalence for each world region. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS\textbackslash n12 international experts were provided with a systematic review of published studies on dementia and were asked to provide prevalence estimates for every WHO world region, for men and women combined, in 5-year age bands from 60 to 84 years, and for those aged 85 years and older. UN population estimates and projections were used to estimate numbers of people with dementia in 2001, 2020, and 2040. We estimated incidence rates from prevalence, remission, and mortality. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nFINDINGS\textbackslash nEvidence from well-planned, representative epidemiological surveys is scarce in many regions. We estimate that 24·3 million people have dementia today, with 4·6 million new cases of dementia every year (one new case every 7 seconds). The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81·1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60\% in 2001, rising to 71\% by 2040). Rates of increase are not uniform; numbers in developed countries are forecast to increase by 100\% between 2001 and 2040, but by more than 300\% in India, China, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbours. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nINTERPRETATION\textbackslash nWe believe that the detailed estimates in this paper constitute the best currently available basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: [corrected] A predictable consequence of cholestasis is malabsorption of fat-soluble factors, (vitamins A, D, E, K) and other free radical scavengers, such as carotenoids. It has been suggested that oxygen-derived free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic liver damage. AIMS: (i) To evaluate retinol, alpha-tocopherol and carotenoid plasma levels in two groups of patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease (primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis); (ii) to compare the respective plasma levels with those of the general population; (iii) to correlate the plasma levels with disease severity. METHODS: A total of 105 patients with chronic cholestasis were included in the study: 86 with primary biliary cirrhosis (81 female, five male, mean age 55.5 +/- 11 years), 19 with primary sclerosing cholangitis (seven female, 12 male, mean age 35 +/- 11 years; six patients had associated inflammatory bowel disease); 105 sex- and age-matched subjects from the general population in the same geographical area (88 female, 17 male, mean age 51.3.5 +/- 10 years) served as controls. Carotenoids (lutein zeaxanthin, lycopene, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin), retinol and alpha-tocopherol were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to each subject to evaluate the quality and the quantity of dietary compounds. Data were processed by analysis of variance and linear regression analysis, as appropriate. RESULTS: Both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis patients had significantly lower levels of retinol, alpha-tocopherol, total carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, alpha- and beta-carotene than controls (P {$<$} 0.0001). Among the cholestatic patients, no significant difference in the concentration of antioxidants was observed between primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis subjects. Anti-oxidant plasma levels were not affected by the severity of the histological stage in primary biliary cirrhosis, but a negative correlation was found between total carotenoids and both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (P {$<$} 0.013 and P {$<$} 0.018, respectively). Within the primary sclerosing cholangitis group, no correlation was found between total carotenoids and cholestatic enzymes. Nutritional intake in cholestatic patients was comparable to controls, including fruit and vegetable intake. CONCLUSIONS: Although no clinical sign of deficiency is evident, plasma levels of antioxidants are low in cholestatic patients even in early stages of the disease. This is probably due to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, as well as other mechanisms of hepatic release, suggesting the need for dietary supplementation.},

  abstract = {The French paradox is a dietary anomaly which has focused attention on the Mediterranean diet. Epidemiological studies revealed that this diet, replete in flavonoid-rich foods (Allium and Brassica vegetables, and red wine), correlated with the increased longevity and decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease seen in these populations. The most frequently studied flavonoid, quercetin, has been shown to have biological properties consistent with its sparing effect on the cardiovascular system. Quercetin and other flavonoids have been shown to modify eicosanoid biosynthesis (antiprostanoid and anti-inflammatory responses), protect low-density lipoprotein from oxidation (prevent atherosclerotic plaque formation), prevent platelet aggregation (antithrombic effects), and promote relaxation of cardiovascular smooth muscle (antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic effects). In addition, flavonoids have been shown to have antiviral and carcinostatic properties. However, flavonoids are poorly absorbed from the gut and are subject to degradation by intestinal micro-organisms. The amount of quercetin that remains biologically available may not be of sufficient concentration, theoretically, to explain the beneficial effects seen with the Mediterranean diet. The role of flavonoids may transcend their presence in food. The activity of flavonoids as inhibitors of reverse transcriptase suggests a place for these compounds in the control of retrovirus infections, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition to specific effects, the broad-modulating effects of flavonoids as antioxidants, inhibitors of ubiquitous enzymes (ornithine carboxylase, protein kinase, calmodulin), and promoters of vasodilatation and platelet disaggregation can serve as starting material for drug development programmes. © 1995.}

  abstract = {Phalaenopsis hybrids contain two 1,2-saturated pyrrolizidine monoesters, T-phalaenopsine (necine base trachelanthamidine) and its stereoisomer Is-phalaenopsine (necine base isoretronecanol). T-Phalaenopsine is the major alkaloid accounting for more than 90\% of total alkaloid. About equal amounts of alkaloid were genuinely present as free base and its N-oxide. The structures were confirmed by GC-MS. The quantitative distribution of phalaenopsine in various organs and tissues of vegetative rosette plants and flowering plants revealed alkaloid in all tissues. The highest concentrations were found in young and developing tissues (e.g., root tips and young leaves), peripheral tissues (e.g., of flower stalks) and reproductive organs (flower buds and flowers). Within flowers, parts that usually attract insect visitors (e.g., labellum with colorful crests as well as column and pollinia) show the highest alkaloid levels. Tracer feeding experiments with 14C-labeled putrecine revealed that in rosette plants the aerial roots were the sites of phalaenopsine biosynthesis. However active biosynthesis was only observed in roots still attached to the plant but not in excised roots. There is a slow but substantial translocation of newly synthesized alkaloid from the roots to other plant organs. A long-term tracer experiment revealed that phalaenopsine shows neither turnover nor degradation. The results are discussed in the context of a polyphyletic molecular origin of the biosynthetic pathways of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in various scattered angiosperm taxa. The ecological role of the so called non-toxic 1,2-saturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids is discussed in comparison to the pro-toxic 1,2-unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Evidence from the plant-insect interphase is presented indicating a substantial role of the 1,2-saturated alkaloids in plant and insect defense. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This is the first book written for pharmacists and pharmaceutical technologists which not only critically summarizes the enormous amount of literature available, but which can be used as a handbook when looking for solutions to practical problems.  The fundamentals -- chemistry of cyclodextrins and their derivatives -- their physical and chemical properties are condensed to the most relevant items in Chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 3 deals with the adsorption, metabolism and toxicological properties of cyclodextrins. Chapter 4 explains the formulation, structure, composition and advantageous effects of the cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. Chapter 5 describes the methods for preparation and characterization of drug/cyclodextrin complexes. Chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to the pharmacokinetics, biopharmaceutical and technological aspects of drug/CD complexes. Chapter 8 treats the application and effects of cyclodextrins in various drug formulations. The Appendix comprises a collection of recipes for any type of drug formulation.  This book is aimed at those who use cyclodextrins in drug formulations, to improve the properties of existing drug formulations, or who want to prepare quite new formulations.},

We tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress is already increased in early stage type II diabetes, and that troglitazone may prevent the increase. Three groups of 20 week old rats were studied: untreated Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, as an animal model of type II diabetes, OLETF rats treated with troglitazone, and control Long- Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. Plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) concentration, as an indication of lipid peroxidation, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the thoracic aorta were measured. Plasma LOOH concentration was significantly higher in non-treated OLETF rats compared to LETO rats and treatment with troglitazone completely prevented this increase. SOD activity was significantly decreased in non-treated OLETF rats compared to LETO rats and troglitazone attenuated the diminution of it. These observations demonstrate oxidative stress is already increased in the early stage of type II diabetes and we confirmed troglitazone has the effect of an antioxidant in vivo.},

The purity was relatively high, and they were composed mostly of saccharides. The molecular weight of the SSPS, as determined by a viscometric method, was approximately 114 000. The SSPS solution was lower in viscosity than that reported by Thompson et al., (Thompson, D.B., Huang, C., \& Sieglaff, C. (1987). Rheological behavior of soluble polysaccharides fractions from soybean. Food Hydrocolloids, 1, 333-337) who investigated the polysaccharides extracted by the method of Morita (Morita, M. (1965). Polysaccharides of soybean seeds: polysaccharide constituents of "hot-water-extract" fraction of soybean seed and an arabinogalactan as its major component. Agric. Biol. Chem., 29, 564-573), and the viscosity was higher than polysaccharides extracted by the method of Aspinall et al. (Aspinall, G.O., Begbie, R., Hamilton, A., \& Whyte, J.N.C. (1967). Polysaccharides of soybeans: extraction and fractionation of polysaccharides from cotyledon meal. J. Chem. Soc. (C), 1065-1070) The SSPS could be dissolved in water at 30\% concentration at 20°C. A 10\% solution of SSPS showed Newtonian behavior. This solution did not undergo gelation in the range of 5-80°C. Although this SSPS contained approximately 20\% uronic acid, it did not show reactivity with polyvalent cations. The viscosity of the SSPS solution increased slightly with increasing pH, and this increase was reversible. We conclude that SSPS have strong glucosidic bonds that enable them to endure the sterilization at 120°C for 15 min at pH 3-6. Further, the behavior of the viscosities of dilute solutions suggests that galacturonic acids, such as uronic acid, exist closely together in the SSPS structure. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Fruits and vegetables are key foods whose high ingestion is associated with the improvement of numerous pathological conditions, including hypertension. Such health promoting actions have been increasingly ascribed to the antioxidant characteristics of different polyphenols in fruits and vegetables. Consequently, based on this assumption, many beverages and foods rich in polyphenols, grape, tea, cocoa, and soy products and many of their chemical constituents purified, are being studied both, as antioxidants and antihypertensive agents. This paper reviews the current evidence linking high polyphenol consumption with reductions in blood pressure. Basic chemical aspects of flavanols, flavonols, isoflavones and stilbenes, as possible responsible for the observed effects of those foods on blood pressure are included. Human intervention studies by using grapes and wine, cocoa and chocolate, black and green tea, soy products, and purified compounds ((+)-catequin, quercetin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate) are summarized. The discussed hypothesis, strongly supported by experimental data in animals, is that by regulating nitric oxide bioavailability, polyphenols present in fruits and vegetables affect endothelial function and as a consequence, blood pressure. Even when data are not definitive and many questions remain open, the whole evidence is encouraging to start considering diets that can provide benefits to hypertensive subjects, and those benefits will be more significant in people that do not have controlled his/her elevated blood pressure. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.}

Solanum torvum Swartz. fruit is widely used in the traditional system of medicine to treat diabetes. In the present study methyl caffeate, isolated from S. torvum fruit, was screened for its efficacy in controlling diabetes in animal models. Antihyperglycemic effect of methyl caffeate was studied in normal glucose-fed rats. The effects of oral administration of methyl caffeate (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) for 28 days on body weight, fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, hemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, total protein, hepatic glycogen and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats were investigated. Histological observations in the pancreas and GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscles were also studied. Methyl caffeate at 40 mg/kg significantly prevented the increase in blood glucose level after glucose administration at 60 min in comparison to the hyperglycemic control group. In streptozotocin induced diabetic rats, methyl caffeate produced significant reduction in blood glucose and increased body weight. The levels and/or activities of other biochemical parameters were near normal due to treatment with methyl caffeate. Methyl caffeate treated diabetic rats showed upregulation of GLUT4 and regeneration of ??-cells in the pancreas. These results substantiated that methyl caffeate possessed hypoglycemic effect, and it could be developed into a potent oral antidiabetic drug. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang (DBT), an aqueous extract of Radix Astragali and Radix Angelica sinensis, is a classical prescription in Traditional Chinese Medicine for treating inflammation and ischemic diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of a modified recipe of DBT, with addition of Panax notoginseng, in treating diabetic retinopathy. An aqueous extract of Radix Astragali, Radix Angelica sinensis, and Panax notoginseng (RRP) was given to Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and streptozotocin-induced Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Leukostasis, vascular leakage, and acellular capillaries in retinal vasculature of animals were determined. Expression of retinal inflammatory biomarkers was assessed. We found that RRP reduced leukostasis, acellular capillaries, and vascular leakage compared to diabetic control rats. We also found that RRP decreased the expression of inflammatory factors including IL-1 beta , IL-6, TNF- alpha , NF- kappa B, MCP-1, ICAM-1, or VCAM-1 in the retinas of GK rats and reversed high glucose-induced inhibition of endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro. We conclude that RRP has a potent effect in preventing the pathogenesis and/or progression of DR and thus may serve as a promising nontoxic therapeutic approach of DR.},

  abstract = {Purpose. The main purpose of this study is to prepare and characterize polysaccharides from Panax notoginseng, investigate their effects on immune system in vitro in order to find new immunostimulants for the prevention and supporting treatment of infection and immunodeficiency related diseases. Methods. Polysaccharides were extracted with aqueous solution, separated with column chromatography. Their anticomplementary activities were investigated by using human serum and antibody-sensitized sheep red blood cells. Interferon-(gamma) and tumor necrosis factor inductive activities were studied by using isolated mouse spleen lymphocytes and peritoneal macrophages, respectively. Results. Four polysaccharides, homogeneous in gel-filtration chromatography, were prepared and designated PF3111, PF3112, PBGA11, and PBGA12. Component sugar analysis revealed that they are heteroglycans with MWs ranging from 37 kD to 760 kD, composed of glucose, galactose, arabinose, mannose, and xylose in different molar ratios. Fraction PBGA12 has the most anticomplementary activity which is mediated through both alternative and classical pathways. All the polysaccharides except PBGA11 induced the production of interferon-(gamma) in the presence of concanavalin A. They induced the production of significant amount of TNF-(alpha) in cell cultures. Conclusions. The polysaccharides from P. notoginseng have immunostimulating activities in vitro.},

However, it is not known which saponin accounts for this haemostatic effect. Hence, in the present study we aimed to identify which saponins contribute to its haemostatic activity and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH:Platelet aggregation was analysed using a platelet aggregometer. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time were measured using a blood coagulation analyser, which was further corroborated with bleeding time and thrombotic assays. The interaction of notoginsenoside Ft1 with the platelet P2Y12 receptor was determined by molecular docking analysis, cytosolic Ca(2+) and cAMP measurements, and phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt assays.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nKEY RESULTS:Among the saponins examined, Ft1 was the most potent procoagulant and induced dose-dependent platelet aggregation. Ft1 reduced plasma coagulation indexes, decreased tail bleeding time and increased thrombogenesis. Moreover, it potentiated ADP-induced platelet aggregation and increased cytosolic Ca(2+) accumulation, effects that were attenuated by clopidogrel. Molecular docking analysis suggested that Ft1 binds to platelet P2Y12 receptors. The increase in intracellular Ca(2+) evoked by Ft1 in HEK293 cells overexpressing P2Y12 receptors could be blocked by ticagrelor. Ft1 also affected the production of cAMP and increased phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt downstream of P2Y12 signalling pathways.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS:Ft1 enhanced platelet aggregation by activating a signalling network mediated through P2Y12 receptors. These novel findings may contribute to the effective utilization of this compound in the therapy of haematological disorders.},

Specifically, laminarin and fucoidan from brown macroalgae have a wide variety of potential industrial applications including functional foods and nutraceuticals, due to their broad range of biological activities. These beneficial biological activities are related to the chemical composition and structure of the macroalgal polysaccharides. The molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and sulphate content of these polysaccharides could be influenced by both macroalgal biology (i.e. variations in polysaccharide composition due to macroalgae species and their biological cycle) and different extraction/purification techniques employed to obtain polysaccharide enriched products (i.e. de-sulphation or fragmentation of sulphated polysaccharides). This review focuses on the extraction and purification methods for the macroalgal polysaccharides laminarin and fucoidan used in the recent literature. The application of innovative extraction technologies (such as ultrasound, microwave and enzyme-assisted extractions), as well as new purification techniques (i.e. membrane separation), are also discussed together with the challenges concerning molecule structure-function relationship and macroalgal variability.},

Since ginsenoside-Rg1 is the most abundant component of P. notoginseng saponins, we investigated the effect of ginsenoside-Rg1 on experimental liver fibrosis in rats. Histological analysis revealed that ginsenoside-Rg1 significantly improved the extent of liver fibrosis in rats induced by thioacetamide. Ginsenoside-Rg1 markedly suppressed the serum levels of fibrotic markers and hepatic hydroxyproline content in rats treated with thioacetamide. Ginsenoside-Rg1 also reduced the serum levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase. Finally, ginsenoside-Rg1 attenuated the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in livers of rats treated by thioacetamide. In cultured hepatic stellate cells, ginsenoside-Rg1 markedly inhibited cell proliferation, activation and formation of reactive oxygen species stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Additionally, ginsenoside-Rg1 down-regulated the expression of PDGF receptor-β by reducing the nuclear factor-κB activity, which was required for the gene expression. These results suggest that ginsenoside-Rg1, which exhibits its antioxidant and antifibrotic properties, may be of potential therapeutic value in protecting the liver fibrosis. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Risk factors include chronic hepatitis B (estimated prevalence of 12\%), chronic hepatitis C (at least 2\% prevalence), and heavy consumption of alcohol among men. This combination of factors has resulted in liver cancer being the most common cause of cancer death in Viet Nam. There is a general lack of understanding by both the general public and health-care providers about the major risk to health that liver disease represents. We report here the initial steps taken as part of a comprehensive approach to liver disease that will ultimately include nationwide education for health-care providers, health educators, and the public; expansion of nationwide screening for hepatitis B and C followed by hepatitis B virus vaccination or treatment of chronic hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C; education about alcoholic liver disease; long-term surveillance for liver cancer; reduction of infection transmission related to medical, commercial, and personal re-use of contaminated needles, syringes, sharp instruments, razors, and inadequately sterilized medical equipment; and ongoing collection and analysis of data about the prevalence of all forms of liver disease and the results of the expanded screening, vaccination, and treatment programs. We report the beginning results of our pilot hepatitis B screening program. We believe that this comprehensive nationwide approach could substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality from liver disease and greatly lessen the burden in terms of both lives lost and health-care costs.},

The aim of this study was to quantify the annual medical costs of peripheral neuropathy and its complications among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-of-illness model was used to estimate the numbers of diabetic individuals in the U.S. who have diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and/or neuropathic foot ulcers (both those with no deep infection and those accompanied by cellulitis or osteomyelitis) at a given point in time, and/or a toe, foot, or leg amputation during a year. Prevalence and incidence rates were estimated from published studies and applied to the general U.S. population. All costs were estimated in 2001 U.S. dollars. In a sensitivity analysis, we varied the rates of complications to assess the robustness of the cost estimates. RESULTS: The annual costs of DPN and its complications in the U.S. were 0.8 billion US dollars (type 1 diabetes), 10.1 billion US dollars (type 2 diabetes), and 10.9 billion US dollars (total). After allowing for uncertainty in the point estimates of complication rates, the range of costs were between 0.3 and 1.0 billion US dollars (type 1 diabetes), 4.3b and 12.7 billion US dollars (type 2 diabetes), and 4.6 and 13.7 billion US dollars (type 1 and type 2 diabetes). CONCLUSIONS: The total annual cost of DPN and its complications in the U.S. was estimated to be between 4.6 and 13.7 billion US dollars. Up to 27\% of the direct medical cost of diabetes may be attributed to DPN.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species contribute decisively to a great variety of diseases. Flavonoids are benzo-gamma-pyrone derivatives of plant origin found in various fruits and vegetables but also in tea and in red wine. Some of the flavonoids, such as quercetin and silibinin, can effectively protect cells and tissues against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. Their antioxidant activity results from scavenging of free radicals and other oxidizing intermediates, from the chelation of iron or copper ions and from inhibition of oxidases. For their free radical scavenging properties, scavenging of lipid- and protein-derived radicals is presumably of special importance. A non-radical reactive oxygen species effectively trapped by flavonoids is hypochlorous acid. In general, the antioxidative properties of flavonoids are favoured by a high degree of OH substitution. On the other hand, inhibition of enzymatic functions other than oxidases, e.g., inhibition of lipoxygenase and thus prevention of the formation of leukotrienes, may also participate in the cell and tissue protective properties of flavonoids.}

This study was designed to investigate the effects of ginsenoside-Rd from total saponins of panax notoginseng on receptor-operated (ROCC) and store-operated (SOCC) Ca2+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells using fura-2 fluorescence, whole cell patch clamp ion channel recording, radio-ligand-receptor binding, 45Ca2+ radio-trace and organ bath techniques. It was found that ginsenoside-Rd reduced phenylephrine-induced contractile responses and Ca2+ influx in normal media without significant effect on these responses in Ca2+ -free media. Ginsenoside-Rd also decreased phenylephrine- and thapsigargin-induced inward Ca2+ currents, and attenuated thapsigargin- and 1-oleoy-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG)-induced cation entries that are coupled to ROCC and SOCC respectively. Ginsenoside-Rd failed to inhibit KCl-induced contraction of rat aortal rings and Ca2+ influx, and did not alter voltage-dependent inward Ca2+ current (VDCC) which was blocked by nifedipine. Also, ginsenoside-Rd did not change binding site and affinity of [3H]-prazosin for alpha1-adrenoceptor in the vascular plasma membrane. These results suggest that ginsenoside-Rd, as an inhibitor, remarkably inhibits Ca2+ entry through ROCC and SOCC without effects on VDCC and Ca2+ release in vascular smooth muscle cells.},

Herb medicines have been used to treat CVD long ago in china and several natural products or derivatives (e.g., aspirin and reserpine) are most common drugs all over the world. The objective of this work was to construct a systematic database for drug discovery based on natural products separated from CVD-related medicinal herbs and to research on action mechanism of herb medicines. Description The cardiovascular disease herbal database (CVDHD) was designed to be a comprehensive resource for virtual screening and drug discovery from natural products isolated from medicinal herbs for cardiovascular-related diseases. CVDHD comprises 35230 distinct molecules and their identification information (chemical name, CAS registry number, molecular formula, molecular weight, international chemical identifier (InChI) and SMILES), calculated molecular properties (AlogP, number of hydrogen bond acceptor and donors, etc.), docking results between all molecules and 2395 target proteins, cardiovascular-related diseases, pathways and clinical biomarkers. All 3D structures were optimized in the MMFF94 force field and can be freely accessed. Conclusions CVDHD integrated medicinal herbs, natural products, CVD-related target proteins, docking results, diseases and clinical biomarkers. By using the methods of virtual screening and network pharmacology, CVDHD will provide a platform to streamline drug/lead discovery from natural products and explore the action mechanism of medicinal herbs.

  abstract = {Aging is an inevitable part of life and is becoming a worldwide social, economic and health problem. This is mainly due to the fact that the increasing proportion of individuals in the advanced age category have a higher probability of developing age-related disorders, such as type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, sarcopenia, and neurodegenerative conditions. New therapeutic approaches are still needed to decrease or slow the effects of such diseases. Advances in -omic technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, have significantly advanced our understanding of disease in multiple medical areas, as the analysis of multiple molecular networks has simultaneously provided a more integrated view of disease pathways. It is hoped that emerging hits from these analyses might be prioritized for further screening as potential novel drug targets for increasing the human healthspan in line with the lifespan. In turn, this will lead to new therapeutic strategies as well as drug development projects by the pharmaceutical industry. This book presents a series of reviews describing studies that have resulted in identification of new potential drug targets for age-related disorders. Much of this information has come from -omic comparisons of healthy and disease states or from testing the effects of new therapeutic approaches. Authored by experts from around the globe, each chapter is presented in the context of specific chronic diseases or therapeutic strategies. This book is designed for researchers in the areas of aging and chronic disease, as well as clinical scientists, physicians and stakeholders in major drug companies},

  abstract = {Saponins are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and have been shown to be active components of many medicinal herbs. In this study, a two-dimensional purification method based on reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography was successfully applied to purify saponins from leaves of Panax notoginseng. Nine saponin reference standards were used to test the separation modes and columns. The standards could not be resolved using C18 columns owing to their limited polar selectivity. However, they were completely separated on a XAmide column in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mode, including two pairs of standards that were coeluted on a C18 column. The elution order of the standards on the two columns was sufficiently different, with a correlation coefficient between retention times on the C18 and XAmide columns of 0.0126, indicating good column orthogonality. Therefore, the first-dimension preparation was performed on a C18 column, followed by a XAmide column that was used to separate the fractions in the second dimension. Fifty-four fractions were prepared in the first dimension, with 25 fractions rich in saponins. Eight saponins, including two pairs of isomeric saponins and one new saponin, were isolated and identified from three representative fractions. This procedure was shown to be an effective approach for the preparative isolation and purification of saponins from leaves of P. notoginseng. Moreover, this method could possibly be employed in the purification of low-content and novel active saponins from natural products.}

  abstract = {Background Natural products have been an important source of lead compounds for drug discovery. How to find and evaluate bioactive natural products is critical to the achievement of drug/lead discovery from natural products. Methodology We collected 19,7201 natural products structures, reported biological activities and virtual screening results. Principal component analysis was employed to explore the chemical space, and we found that there was a large portion of overlap between natural products and FDA-approved drugs in the chemical space, which indicated that natural products had large quantity of potential lead compounds. We also explored the network properties of natural product-target networks and found that polypharmacology was greatly enriched to those compounds with large degree and high betweenness centrality. In order to make up for a lack of experimental data, high throughput virtual screening was employed. All natural products were docked to 332 target proteins of FDA-approved drugs. The most potential natural products for drug discovery and their indications were predicted based on a docking score-weighted prediction model. Conclusions Analysis of molecular descriptors, distribution in chemical space and biological activities of natural products was conducted in this article. Natural products have vast chemical diversity, good drug-like properties and can interact with multiple cellular target proteins.}

Chen and Carthamus tinctorius L. has a history of use in traditional medicine for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. Aim of the study: In this study, we investigated the effects of individual herbal extracts and combined extracts on anti-myocardial ischemia injuries in vivo, and determined the proper dosage of Panax notoginseng (EPN) combined with Carthamus tinctorius (ECT) that could strengthen their cardio-protective effects. Meanwhile, their potential anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammation effect were assessed. Material and Methods: SD rats were orally given individual EPN 50, 100 mg/kg, ECT 100, 200 mg/kg, and different combinations between them. Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 24 h. Infarct area was determined with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The biomarkers related to myocardial ischemia injury were determined. Simultaneously, hemodynamic parameters were monitored as left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and maximal rate of increase and decrease of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax). The oxidative stress indicators and inflammatory factors were also evaluated. Results: The results showed EPN or ECT significantly reduced infarct size, improved cardiac function, decreased levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (all P{$<$}0.05 vs. control). EPN or ECT alone also restrained the oxidative stress related to myocardial ischemia injury as evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (all P{$<$}0.05 vs. control). However, this cardio-protective effect was further strengthened by their combinations. Among all the combinations, EPN 50 mg/kg plus ECT 200 mg/kg showed predominant potential to reduce infarct size (22.21±1.72\%, P{$<$}0.05 vs. each single, respectively), preserve cardiac function (P{$<$}0.05 vs. ECT 200 mg/kg for LVEDP and -dP/dtmax) after myocardial ischemia injury in rats. This heart protection was confirmed with the lowered cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P{$<$}0.05 vs. ECT 200 mg/kg and EPN 50 mg/kg, respectively). Oxidative stress and inflammation are the two key factors in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia injury. In the present study, EPN 50 mg/kg plus ECT 200 mg/kg markedly increased SOD and GSH-Px activity (475.30±23.60 U/ml, P{$<$}0.05 vs. each single, respectively), while elevated MDA level was significantly depressed. Meanwhile, the inflammatory cascade was inhibited as evidenced by decreased cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Conclusion: These results demonstrated EPN, ECT and their combinations exhibited significant cardio-protective effects. The findings suggest EPN combined with ECT may be therapeutically more useful for ameliorating anti-myocardial ischemia injuries than individual herbal extract, and EPN 50 mg/kg plus ECT 200 mg/kg is the appropriate combination in the present research. The cardio-protective effect of this combination was achieved partially by decreasing oxidative stress and repressing inflammatory cascade. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Phyllanthin, a poorly water-soluble herbal active component from Phyllanthus amarus, exhibited a low oral bioavailability. This study aims at formulating self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) containing phyllanthin and evaluating their in-vitro and in-vivo performances. Excipient screening was carried out to select oil, surfactant and co-surfactant. Formulation development was based on pseudo-ternary phase diagrams and characteristics of resultant microemulsions. Influences of dilution, pH of media and phyllanthin content on droplet size of the resultant emulsions were studied. The optimized phyllanthin-loaded SMEDDS formulation (phy-SMEDDS) and the resultant microemulsions were characterized by viscosity, self-emulsification performance, stability, morphology, droplet size, polydispersity index and zeta potential. In-vitro dissolution and oral bioavailability in rats of phy-SMEDDS were studied and compared with those of plain phyllanthin. Phy-SMEDDS consisted of phyllanthin/Capryol 90/Cremophor RH 40/Transcutol P (1.38:39.45:44.38:14.79) in \% w/w. Phy-SMEDDS could be emulsified completely within 6 min and formed fine microemulsions, with average droplet range of 27-42 nm. Phy-SMEDDS was robust to dilution and pH of dilution media while the resultant emulsion showed no phase separation or drug precipitation after 8 h dilution. The release of phyllanthin from phy-SMEDDS capsule was significantly faster than that of plain phyllanthin capsule irrespective of pH of dissolution media. Phy-SMEDDS was found to be stable for at least 6 months under accelerated condition. Oral absorption of phyllanthin in rats was significantly enhanced by SMEDDS as compared with plain phyllanthin. Our study indicated that SMEDDS for oral delivery of phyllanthin could be an option to enhance its bioavailability.},

This study dealt with the isolation and physicochemical characterization of phyllanthin. Phyllanthin was isolated from P. amarus leaves by column chromatography and purified by recrystallization to obtain phyllanthin crystals with a purity of more than 98\%. UV, IR, MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were employed to identify phyllanthin. The physicochemical properties of phyllanthin were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, pH-solubility, ionization property and lipophilicity. The results indicated that phyllanthin crystals had the melting point and melting enthalpy range of 96.67-97.03 °C and 109.61-116.34 J/g, respectively. Three kinds of phyllanthin crystals, recrystallized by petroleum ether, absolute ethanol and 25\% ethanol solution, showed only one polymorph and no polymorphic impurity. Phyllanthin in a solid state was found to undergo significant thermal decomposition above 200 °C. The compound demonstrated good stability in aqueous solution over a pH range of 1.07-10.02 for at least 4 h. The solubility of phyllanthin appeared to be pH-independent of pH range from 1.07 to 10.26. Ionization property studied by absorbance spectroscopy method was in agreement with the result of pH-solubility study, showing that phyllanthin has no pKa over a pH range of 1.12-10.02. The log Pow value of phyllanthin was found to be 3.30 ± 0.05 at pH 7.48, suggesting that phyllanthin may have good permeability through biological membranes. The findings could be useful tools for the development of stable and bioavailable oral dosage forms of phyllanthin. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

The optimized geometric parameters of compound 1 were calculated for the first time. The theoretical vibrational frequencies of 1 were found to correlate with the experimental IR spectrum after a scaling factor of 0.9811. The UV and NMR spectral data computed theoretically were in good agreement with the experimental data. Electronic properties of the compound i.e., ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), coefficients of HOMO and LUMO were estimated computationally for the first time which can be used to explain its antioxidant as well as other related activities and more active sites on it. The intermolecular interactions and their effects on IR frequencies, electronic and geometric parameters were simulated using water molecule as a model for hydrogen bonding with flavonoid hydroxyl groups.}

This study was designed to investigate the profiles of P. notoginseng saponin extract (PNSE), the major bioactive ingredients in P. notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen, by high-performance liquid chromatography, and, for the first time, the anticancer effect of PNSE in the human colon cancer cell line LoVo was further evaluated. The major saponins present in PNSE were ginsenosides Rg1 (31.1\%) and Rb1 (34.4\%), and the total content of the eight saponins identified (notoginsenoside R1, ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, and Rd, and isomeric ginsenosides Rb2 and Rb3) was 81.7\%, indicating that it was a highly purified standardized saponin extract. Furthermore, PNSE was found to have a markedly cytotoxic effect and antiproliferative activity against the LoVo cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that PNSE caused cell cycle arrest at S phase. Moreover, PNSE was found to possess antioxidative capacities in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging assay and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay in vitro. Taken together, the present results suggest that naturally occurring PNSE may provide significant natural defense against human colon cancer.},

  abstract = {Aims: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for treating complex chronic diseases owing to their fewer side-effects, better patient tolerance and relatively less cost. The present work was carried out to study the anti-diabetic efficacy and mechanisms of 34 TCMs. Materials and methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice were orally administrated with corresponding herbal solution once a day for 4 weeks. At the end of experiment, the level of plasma glucose, malondialdehyde (MDA), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the serum aldose reductase (AR) were determined, the effects of TCM extract on α-glucosidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro were also evaluated. Results: 13 out of the 34 herbs showed a statistically significant plasma glucose lowering action compared with the diabetic control group. Biochemical analysis revealed that Atractylodes macrocephala, Codonopsis pilosula, Dioscorea opposite, Flos lonicerae and Pueraria lobata may retard the progression of diabetes via reduce the blood glucose level and prevent the increase of AR activity. Other tested herbs, such as Ramulus cinnamomi, Cinnamomum cassia, and Eucommia ulmoides, showed the antidiabetic ability by either prevent the decrease in SOD activity or suppress the increase of MDA. Zymologic assay reveals that Pueraria lobata and Anemarrhena asphodeloides showed the highest inhibition against α-glucosidase and ACE respectively. Interestingly, the post-treatment glucose levels and AR activity were positively correlated with kidney/body weight of 34 herbs treated diabetic mice (p = 0.02, 0.04 respectively). Conclusions: Several potential antidiabetic herbs derived from Chinese traditional pharmacopeia such as Dioscorea opposite, Pueraria lobata, Codonopsis pilosula and Ramulus cinnamomi, have been found to exert a beneficial action on diabetes and diabetic complications via multi-mechanisms. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In a previous study, we had shown that a species’ abundance [as expressed by the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)] dataset is a core determinant for the development of a natural product into a medicine. Our overarching aim is to understand the unique requirements for natural product-based drug development. Web of Science was queried for research on alkaloids in combination with plant systematics/taxonomy. All alkaloids containing species demonstrated an average increase of 8.66 in GBIF occurrences between 2014 and 2020. Medicinal Species with alkaloids show higher abundance compared to non-medicinal alkaloids, often linked also to cultivation. Alkaloids with high biodiversity are often simple alkaloids found in multiple species with the presence of ’driver species‘ and are more likely to be included in early-stage drug development compared to ‘rare’ alkaloids. Similarly, the success of an alkaloid containing species as a food supplement (‘botanical’) is linked to its abundance. GBIF is a useful tool for assessing the druggability of a compound from a certain source species. The success of any development programme from natural sources must take sustainable sourcing into account right from the start.},

  abstract = {Sulforaphane (SFN), an aliphatic isothiocyanate, is a known cancer chemopreventive agent. Aiming to investigate anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SFN, we here report a potent decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic signaling factors in cultured Raw 264.7 macrophages after SFN treatment, i.e. NO, prostaglandin E(2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha. SFN did not directly interact with NO, nor did it inhibit inducible nitric-oxide synthase enzymatic activity. Western blot analyses revealed time- and dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced inducible nitric-oxide synthase as well as Cox-2 protein expression, which was suppressed at the transcriptional level. To reveal the target of SFN beyond its anti-inflammatory action, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses of transcription factor-DNA binding. Consequently, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), a pivotal transcription factor in LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory response, was identified as the key mediator. SFN selectively reduced DNA binding of NF-kappa B without interfering with LPS-induced degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappa B nor with nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. Because SFN can interact with thiol groups by dithiocarbamate formation, it may impair the redox-sensitive DNA binding and transactivation of NF-kappa B. Sulforaphane could either directly inactivate NF-kappa B subunits by binding to essential Cys residues or interact with glutathione or other redox regulators like thioredoxin and Ref-1 relevant for NF-kappa B function. Our data provide novel evidence that anti-inflammatory mechanisms contribute to sulforaphane-mediated cancer chemoprevention.},

A strong focus is placed on the ReLiBase database system which is a new three-dimensional database for storing and analysing structures of protein–ligand complexes currently deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB). ReLiBase contains efficient query tools for identifying and analysing ligands and protein–ligand complexes. Its application for structure-based drug design is illustrated.}

  abstract = {Stroke and diabetes mellitus are two separate conditions which share multiple common threads. Both are increasing in prevalence, both are diseases which affect blood vessels, and both are associated with other vascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Abnormal glucose regulation, of which diabetes is one manifestation, is seen in up to two-thirds of people suffering from an acute stroke. Surprisingly, aggressive management of glucose after an acute stroke has not been shown to improve outcome or reduce the incidence of further strokes. More encouragingly, active management of other cardiovascular risk factors has been demonstrated to prevent stroke disease and improve outcome following a stroke in the diabetic person. Hypertension should be treated with a target of 140/80\,mmHg, as a maximum. The drug of choice would be an ACE inhibitor, although the priority is blood pressure reduction regardless of the medication chosen. Lipids should be treated with a statin whatever the starting cholesterol. Antiplatelet treatment is also essential but there are no specific recommendations for the diabetic person. As these conditions become more prevalent it is imperative that the right treatment is offered for both primary and secondary prevention in diabetic people, in order to prevent disease and minimize disability.}

The present study aimed to investigate whether an ethanol extract of Anemarrhena asphodeloides would stimulate insulin secretion and if so, further elucidate the mechanism behind this effect.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Isolated pancreatic islets of normal Wistar rats and spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were batch incubated or perifused to study effect of Anemarrhena asphodeloides extract (TH2) on insulin release.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: At 3.3 mM glucose, 2, 4, and 8 mg/ml TH2 increased the insulin release of Wistar rat islets 2.5-, 4.1-, and 5.7-fold, respectively (p {$<$} 0.05) and of GK rat islets 1.7-, 3.0-, and 6.3-fold, respectively (p {$<$} 0.01). Similarly at 16.7 mM glucose, 2, 4 and 8 mg/ml TH2 increased insulin release of Wistar rat islets 1.5-, 2.2-, and 3.8-fold, respectively (p {$<$} 0.05) and of GK rat 2.5-, 4.2-, and 11.9-fold, respectively (p {$<$} 0.01). In perifusions of islets, TH2 also increased insulin secretion that returned to basal levels when TH2 was omitted from the perifusate. Mangiferin had no effect on insulin secretion of islets. In islets depolarized by 30 mM KCl and B-cell K-ATP channels kept open by 0.25 mM diazoxide, TH2 (8 mg/ml) further enhanced insulin secretion at 3.3 but not at 16.7 mM glucose. Pertussis toxin suppressed the insulin stimulating effect of 2 and 8 mg/ml TH2 by 35 \% and 47 \% (p {$<$} 0.05 and p {$<$} 0.001, respectively).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Ethanol extract of the roots of Anemarrhena asphodeloides contains a substance, TH2, that stimulates insulin secretion both at 3.3 and 16.7 mM glucose in islets of normal Wistar and diabetic GK rats. The mechanism behind TH2-stimulated insulin secretion involves an effect on the exocytotic machinery of the B-cell, mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi- (or Ge-) proteins.},

  abstract = {Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that occur ubiquitously in foods of plant origin. Over 4,000 different flavonoids have been described, and they are categorized into flavonols, flavones, catechins, flavanones, anthocyanidins and isoflavonoids. Flavonoids have a variety of biological effects in numerous mammalian cell systems, in vitro as well in vivo. Recently, much attention has been paid to their antioxidant properties and to their inhibitory role in various stages of tumour development in animal studies. Quercetin, the major representative of the flavonol subclass, is a strong antioxidant, and prevents oxidation of low density lipoproteins in vitro. Oxidized low density lipoproteins are atherogenic, and are considered to be a crucial intermediate in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. This agrees with observations in epidemiological studies that the intake of flavonols and flavones was inversely associated with subsequent coronary heart disease. However, no effects of flavonols on cancer were found in these studies. The extent of absorption of flavonoids is an important unsolved problem in judging their many alleged health effects. Flavonoids present in foods were considered non-absorbable because they are bound to sugars as β-glycosides. Only free flavonoids without a sugar molecule, the so-called aglycones, were thought to be able to pass through the gut wall. Hydrolysis only occurs in the colon by microorganisms, which at the same time degrade flavonoids. We performed a study to quantify absorption of various dietary forms of quercetin. To our surprise, the quercetin glycosides from onions were absorbed far better than the pure aglycone. Subsequent pharmacokinetic studies with dietary quercetin glycosides showed marked differences in absorption rate and bioavailability. Absorbed quercetin was eliminated only slowly from the blood. The metabolism of flavonoids has been studied frequently in various animals, but very few data in humans are available. Two major sites of flavonoid metabolism are the liver and the colonic flora. There is evidence for O-methylation, sulphation and glucuronidation of hydroxyl groups in the liver. Bacterial ring fission of flavonoids occurs in the colon. The subsequent degradation products, phenolic acids, can be absorbed and are found in urine of animals. Quantitative data on metabolism are scarce.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis plays an important role in a wide range of physiological processes such as wound healing and fetal development. In fact, many diseases are associated with imbalance in the regulation of angiogenesis in which there is either excessive or insufficient blood vessel formation. Panax notoginseng, a blood circulation invigorating herb, is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat circulation-related diseases. However, the biological effects of saponin extract from Panax notoginseng (PNS) on angiogenesis and the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. This investigation describes the angiogenic effects of PNS on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and zebrafish in vivo. The 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay and microscopic cell counting demonstrated that the extract was able to stimulate the proliferation of HUVECs. Meanwhile, the numbers of invaded cells and tube branches were significantly increased in PNS treatment groups. PNS was also shown to promote changes in the subintestinal vessels, a feature of angiogenesis, in zebrafish. In addition, by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PNS was found to enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and kinase-domain region/fetal liver kinase-1 in mice (KDR/Flk-1) mRNA expression, and the PNS-induced HUVECs proliferation could be abolished by a KDR/Flk-1 inhibitor. Furthermore, the proliferation of HUVECs induced by PNS was significantly attenuated by inhibitors of PI3K-Akt-eNOS. All the results suggest that PNS can promote angiogenesis, and that the proangiogenic effects involve the VEGF-KDR/Flk-1 and PI3K-Akt-eNOS signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {One increasingly popular type of alternative therapy is aromatherapy, but scientific validation in this field is still rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rose oil ( Rosa damascena Mill, Rosaceae) on human autonomic parameters and emotional responses in healthy subjects after transdermal absorption. In order to exclude any olfactory stimulation the inhalation of the fragrances was prevented by breathing masks. Forty healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. Five autonomic parameters, i.e. blood pressure, breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and skin temperature, were recorded. Emotional responses were assessed by means of rating scales. Compared to placebo, rose oil caused significant decreases of breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure, which indicate a decrease of autonomic arousal. At the emotional level, subjects in the rose oil group rated themselves as more calm, more relaxed and less alert than subjects in the control group. These findings are likely to represent a relaxing effect of the rose oil and provide some evidence for the use of rose oil in aromatherapy, such as causing relief of depression and stress in humans.},

  abstract = {Panax notoginseng and its flowers are both well-known traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. To date, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of flavonoids from P. notoginseng flowers (PNF) remain unclear. In this study, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of flavonoids from PNF were investigated. The crude flavonoids were purified using a column (25 cm × 1.5 cm) packed with AB-8 macroporous adsorption resin. Compared with ascorbic acid, the purified flavonoids excelled in scavenging activities on 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid, superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals at 0.2-1.0 mg/mL concentration. However, flavonoids exhibited weaker reducing power than ascorbic acid at 20-100 μg/mL concentration. In addition, the flavonoids exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results clearly indicate that flavonoids from PNF are effective in scavenging free radicals and have the potential to be used as antioxidants and antimicrobial agents, and also provide the theoretical data for supporting the use of PNF in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.}

  abstract = {Sildenafil citrate (SC), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction, is available in tablet form but has three major problems. First, the drug displays inadequate aqueous solubility, which delays the onset of its action. Second, the drug undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in a low (40\%) bioavailability. Third, the gastrointestinal effects of SC include dyspepsia and a burning sensation. The aim of this research was to prepare SC as a sublingual tablet utilizing soy polysaccharide as novel superdisintegrant to mitigate the abovementioned problems. The solubility of SC in various hydrophilic carrier solutions was estimated in order to prepare the drug as a coprecipitate. Sublingual tablets were prepared and evaluated for hardness, friability, drug content, wetting time, water absorption ratio, in vitro dispersion time, dissolution rate, and stability study. The pharmacokinetic study of the tablets was carried out on healthy volunteers. The results indicated that the co-precipitation of SC with polyvinylpyrollidone K30 enhanced the solubility of SC by more than eight folds. The tablet contained 8\% soy polysaccharide as a superdisintegrant and provided a wetting time of 25 seconds, and in vitro dispersion times of 55 seconds. The drug release was found to be 95.6\%. The prepared SC sublingual tablet also exhibited a rapid onset of action, and its bioavailability was enhanced 1.68-fold compared with that of the marketed tablets. It can be concluded that SC sublingual tablet is a promising formulation that results in higher solubility, faster dispersion and onset of action, higher release rate, and higher systemic bioavailability.},

  abstract = {Our previous studies have shown that Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) play a protective role in learning dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease, inhibit the deposition of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, and reduce the content of App in the brain of SAMP8. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of PNS on α, β, and γ secretase involved in Aβ generation in SAMP8 mice. The results showed that PNS increased α-secretase activity perhaps by enhancing the level of ADAM9 expression, which itself was achieved by upregulating the expression of the ADAM9 gene. In addition, PNS significantly decreased BACE1 protein level by downregulating the level of BACE1 gene expression and consequently precluded the activity of β secretase. However, PNS treatment did not modify γ-secretase activity. Together, our study shows that PNS modulates the levels of protein and gene expressions involved with α and β secretase, thereby increasing α-secretase activity and reducing β-secretase activity, which may be one of the mechanisms of PNS precluding Aβ generation. Accordingly, PNS may be a promising agent for Alzheimer's disease.},

In this study, we sought to determine whether early total eschar excision (EEE) in one operation and the traditional Chinese herb Panax notoginseng (PNS) would be helpful in improving early postburn cardiac function. 160 Wistar rats were randomly divided into burn (burn group, n = 50), burn treated with EEE (EEE group, n = 50), burn treated with PNS (PNS group, n = 50) groups and normal controls (n = 10). All rats except the normal control were given a 30\% TBSA full skin thickness burn and resuscitated with Ringer's lactate. EEE was performed immediately after the burn group received the first intraperitoneal injection of Ringer's lactate. The wound was covered with homoskin from normal rats. In the PNS group, two doses of PNS (200 mg/kg for each dose) were given intraperitoneally immediately and 4 h postburn. Cardiac contractile function and cardiac troponin T (TnT) were determined at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h postburn. Results showed that cardiac contractile parameters including AOSP, AODP, LVSP and +dp/dt(max) all declined and were still significantly lower than the control values at 24 h postburn. Cardiac TnT was elevated markedly and reached a level 25 times higher than control at 12 h postburn. In EEE and PNS groups, the reduction of cardiac contractile function was limited as compared with that in the burn group. Levels of TnT in both EEE and PNS groups were significantly lower than in the burn group 6 h postburn later. The findings of this study demonstrated that both EEE and PNS were effective in improving early postburn cardiac function.},

We have searched the crystallography papers for all 5000+ structures and compiled binding data for 1375 (26\%) of the protein-ligand complexes. The binding-affinity data ranges 13 orders of magnitude. This is the largest collection of binding data reported to date in the literature. We have also addressed the issue of redundancy in the data. To create a nonredundant dataset, one protein from each of the 1780 protein families was chosen as a representative. Representatives were chosen by tightest binding, best resolution, etc. For the 1780 "best" complexes that comprise the nonredundant version of Binding MOAD, 475 (27\%) have binding data. This significant collection of protein-ligand complexes will be very useful in elucidating the biophysical patterns of molecular recognition and enzymatic regulation. The complexes with binding-affinity data will help in the development of improved scoring functions and structure-based drug discovery techniques.

  abstract = {Fissistigma oldhamii (Hemsl.) Merr [F. oldhamii], a traditional Chinese herb medicine, is widely used for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China. Following bioactivity-guided isolation, a representative immunosuppressive compound with low cytotoxicity, 7′-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-N-[(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]propenamide (Z23), was been identified in this herb medicine. We investigated the immunosuppressive effects of Z23 on T cells in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that Z23 in a dose-dependent manner significantly inhibited the proliferation of splenocytes induced by concanavalin A (ConA) and by the mixed lymphocyte culture reaction (MLR), with half inhibitive concentration (IC50) values of 6.22~μM and 0.78~μM, respectively. Z23 also dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and type 1 cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-2) production of primary T cells stimulated by anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs, but did not affect IL-12 production by mouse peritoneal macrophages (pMφ) stimulated with LPS plus IFN-γ in vitro. Administration of Z23 (6.25~mg/kg, 12.5~mg/kg, 25~mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently suppressed 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Furthermore, administration of Z23 (25~mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the incidence and severity of type II bovine collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA), which was associated with the inhibition of CII-specific T cell proliferation and type 1 cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-2) production. In this study, we report that a representative immunosuppressive compound from F. oldhamii, Z23, effectively inhibits murine immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and that the immunosuppressive effects of Z23 might be attributed to suppression of T cell activation and function and Th1 type cytokine production.},

  abstract = {The enzymes and genes of the lignin biosynthetic pathway have been studied for several decades, but the gene encoding ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H) was cloned only 3 years ago by T-DNA tagging in Arabidopsis. To characterize the enzyme in detail, we have expressed F5H in yeast. According to current models of the phenylpropanoid pathway, F5H catalyzes the hydroxylation of ferulate to 5-hydroxyferulate; however, our studies indicate that the enzyme also uses coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol as substrates. Unexpectedly, the K(m) values measured for the latter two substrates are three orders of magnitude lower than that measured for ferulic acid, suggesting that in lignifying tissues, syringyl monomers may be derived from their guaiacyl counterparts by hydroxylation and subsequent methylation. Thus, F5H may function later in the lignin biosynthetic pathway than was originally proposed. To further test this model, recombinant F5H was incubated together with ferulic acid, coniferaldehyde, or coniferyl alcohol in the presence of native or recombinant Arabidopsis caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase and [(14)C]S-adenosylmethionine. In all cases, the corresponding radiolabeled sinapyl derivatives were synthesized, indicating that the necessary enzymes required for this pathway are present in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these data suggest that the previously accepted pathway for lignin biosynthesis is likely to be incorrect.},

The essential oils of Callicarpa candicans showed promising activity, with IC50 values between 45.67 and 58.38 μg/mL. The essential oils of Callicarpa sinuata, Callicarpa petelotii, Callicarpa nudiflora, Callicarpa erioclona and Vitex ajugifolia showed good activity with IC50 values between 28.71 and 54.69 μg/mL.

  abstract = {Volatile compounds of fresh, hot air dried and freeze dried dill (Anethum graveolens L.) herb were studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Of the 25 volatile components identified, 16 the most abundant compounds were analysed quantitatively. The major primary aroma compounds were α-phellandrene, 3,6-dimethyl-2,3,3a,4,5,7a-hexahydrobenzofuran,β-phellandrene, limonene, α-pinene, p-cymene and myristicin. Severe loss of these components occured during the drying of dill. E.g. the retention of the benzofuranoid, the most important aroma component of the dill herb, was from trace to 1.3 \% in hot air dried samples and 3.5—20 \% in freeze dried samples. During the drying secondary aroma compounds are formed consisting over 50 \% of the total volatiles. Among these phytadienes, especially neophytadiene, were the major components. The best result was obtained by freeze drying, but the product contained only one quarter of the total aroma compounds of the fresh dill herb.},

  abstract = {Stress is a major risk factor in the onset of several neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. Although several studies have shown that social isolation stress during postweaning period induces behavioral and brain molecular changes, the effects of social isolation on behavior during adulthood have been less characterized. Aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between the behavioral alterations and brain molecular changes induced by chronic social isolation stress in adult male mice. Plasma corticosterone levels and adrenal glands weight were also analyzed. Socially isolated (SI) mice showed higher locomotor activity, spent less time in the open field center, and displayed higher immobility time in the tail suspension test compared to group-housed (GH) mice. SI mice exhibited reduced plasma corticosterone levels and reduced difference between right and left adrenal glands. SI showed lower mRNA levels of the BDNF-7 splice variant, c-Fos, Arc, and Egr-1 in both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex compared to GH mice. Finally, SI mice exhibited selectively reduced mGluR1 and mGluR2 levels in the prefrontal cortex. Altogether, these results suggest that anxious- and depressive-like behavior induced by social isolation stress correlates with reduction of several neuroplasticity-related genes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of adult male mice.},

  abstract = {The liver is the most important organ that plays an important role in maintaining various physiological processes in the body. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and is characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. There are five main viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D, and E. These five types are of the greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death. Liver injury or liver dysfunction is a major health problem that challenges not only health care professionals but also the drug regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. Herbal medicines have been used in the treatment of liver disease for a long time. The immune system is the part of body that diagnoses the pathogen by using a specific receptor to reveal immediate response by the activation of immune components cells, chemokines, and cytokines, and also the release of the inflammatory mediator. They potentiate and modulate the immune system. The plant-derived phytoconstituents (polysaccharides, proteins and flavanoids, lignans, rotenoids, etc.) stimulate the immune system and maintained hepatic diseases. There are a number of hepatoprotective and immunomodulatory herbs that have been reported. The present review is aimed at compiling data on promising phytochemicals from hepatoprotective and immunomodulatory herbs.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is a key element in enhancing cholinergic transmission and subsequently relieving major symptoms of several neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Here, the inhibitory potential of geraniol and its mechanism of inhibition against AChE were elucidated in vitro and validated via an in silico study. Our in vitro enzyme inhibition kinetics results show that at increasing concentrations of geraniol and substrate, Vmax did not change significantly, but Km increased, which indicates that geraniol is a competitive inhibitor against AChE with an IC50 value 98.06 ± 3.92 µM. All the parameters of the ADME study revealed that geraniol is an acceptable drug candidate. A docking study showed that the binding energy of geraniol (-5.6 kcal mol-1) was lower than that of acetylcholine (-4.1 kcal mol-1) with AChE, which exhibited around a 12.58-fold higher binding affinity of geraniol. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the RMSD of AChE alone or in complex with geraniol fluctuated within acceptable limits throughout the simulation. The mean RMSF value of the complex ensures that the overall conformation of the protein remains conserved. The average values of Rg, MolSA, SASA, and PSA of the complex were 3.16 Å, 204.78, 9.13, and 51.58 Å2, respectively. We found that the total SSE of AChE in the complex was 38.84\% (α-helix: 26.57\% and β-sheets: 12.27\%) and remained consistent throughout the simulation. These findings suggest that geraniol remained inside the binding cavity of AChE in a stable conformation. Further in vivo investigation is required to fully characterize the pharmacokinetic properties, optimization of dose administration, and efficacy of this plant-based natural compound.},

We have therefore prepared a library of 727 842 molecules, each with 3D structure, using catalogs of compounds from vendors (the size of this library continues to grow). The molecules have been assigned biologically relevant protonation states and are annotated with properties such as molecular weight, calculated LogP, and number of rotatable bonds. Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules. This database is available for free download (http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES, mol2, 3D SDF, and DOCK flexibase format. A Web-based query tool incorporating a molecular drawing interface enables the database to be searched and browsed and subsets to be created. Users can process their own molecules by uploading them to a server. Our hope is that this database will bring virtual screening libraries to a wide community of structural biologists and medicinal chemists.}

The aim of this study was to reveal the interfacial properties and the emulsifying properties of two types of oil bodies extracted from soybean seeds at different pH conditions, that is purified oil bodies (OB) and crude oil bodies (OBC) including storage and other minor proteins. Particle size and zeta-potential measurements and SDS-PAGE revealed that the presence of the involved storage and other minor proteins promoted oil body aggregations and imparted the high zeta-potential to the oil bodies. OB adsorbed onto the oil-water (O/W) interface in closely packed state and formed more elastic adsorbed layer than OBC according to the results from tensiometry. Emulsions stabilized by OB (OB-E) were more stable against oil droplet coalescence than those by OBC (OBC-E) due to the absence of the involved proteins at the emulsion droplet surfaces. Cryo-SEM observation suggests that during emulsification most of the OB and OBC particles adsorbed onto the newly-created O/W interface and then rapidly ruptured.},

Citrus fragrance has been used by aromatherapists for the treatment of anxiety symptoms. Based on this claim, the aim of present study was to investigate the effect of aromatherapy with essential oil of orange on child anxiety during dental treatment. Materials and Methods: Thirty children (10 boys, 20 girls) aged 6-9 years participated in a crossover intervention study, according to the inclusion criteria, among patients who attended the pediatric department of Isfahan Dental School in 2011. Every child underwent two dental treatment appointments including dental prophylaxis and fissure-sealant therapy under orange aroma in one session (intervention) and without any aroma (control) in another one. Child anxiety level was measured using salivary cortisol and pulse rate before and after treatment in each visit. The data were analyzed using t-test by SPSS software version 18. Results: The mean ± SD and mean difference of salivary cortisol levels and pulse rate were calculated in each group before and completion of treatment in each visit. The difference in means of salivary cortisol and pulse rate between treatment under orange odor and treatment without aroma was 1.047 ± 2.198 nmol/l and 6.73 ± 12.3 (in minutes), which was statistically significant using paired t-test (P = 0.014, P = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: It seems that the use of aromatherapy with natural essential oil of orange could reduce salivary cortisol and pulse rate due to child anxiety state.},

  abstract = {Objective: Periodontitis is a group of inflammatory diseases that affect connective tissue attachments and the supporting bone that surround the teeth. Osteoclasts are responsible for skeletal modeling and remodeling but may also destroy bone in several bone diseases, including osteoporosis and periodontitis. This study examined the anti-inflammatory effects of Panax notoginseng (PN) on periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) and RAW264.7 cells under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory conditions. Design: The effects of PN on PDLFs were determined by measuring the cell viability and mRNA expression of tissue-destructive proteins. The effects of PN on osteoclasts were examined by measuring the following: (1) the cell viability, (2) the formation of Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)(+) multinucleated cells, (3) MAPK signaling pathways, (4) mRNA expression of inflammatory-related proteins and (5) nitric oxide (NO) production. Results: The n-butanol extracts of PN (bPN) increased the cell proliferation of the PDLFs and decreased the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in the PDLFs. bPN inhibited the formation of LPS-stimulated TRAP(+) multinucleated cells. bPN also inhibited the LPS-stimulated activation of JNK and ERK signaling, and inhibited the LPS-stimulated degradation of IKB in the RAW264.7 cells. In addition, bPN decreased the mRNA expression of MMP-9 and iNOS, which are involved in the range of pathophysiological processes, such as inflammation in the RAW264.7 cells. NO production was also decreased via the inhibition of iNOS. Conclusions: These findings suggest that bPN has therapeutic effects on bone-destructive processes, such as those that occur in periodontal diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive GC-MS analysis of 8 Ipomoea species belonging to the subgenus Quamoclit, section Mina revealed that the members of this taxon form combinations of two necine bases with rare necic acids resulting in unique pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The occurrence and diversity of these metabolites show remarkable variations: Some species, especially Ipomoea hederifolia and Ipomoea lobata, are able to synthesize a large number of alkaloids whereas others, especially Ipomoea coccinea and Ipomoea quamoclit, are poor synthesizers with only a few compounds. However, these metabolites are apparently chemotaxonomic markers of this infrageneric taxon in general. They represent either esters of (-)-platynecine (altogether 48 ipangulines and 4 further esters including results of a previous study) or esters of (-)-trachelanthamidine, an additional novel structural type called minalobines (altogether 21 alkaloids). Both types are characterized by section-specific rare necic acids, e.g., ipangulinic/isoipangulinic acid, phenylacetic acid. The alkaloids of Ipomoea cholulensis, I. coccinea, I. hederifolia, Ipomoea neei, and Ipomoea quamoclit were mono and diesters of platynecine. Minalobines turned out to be metabolites of I. lobata (Cerv.) Thell. (syn.: Mina lobata Cerv.) lacking ipangulines. The major alkaloid of this species, minalobine R, has been isolated and identified as 9-O-(threo-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylacetoxy-butyryl)-(-)-trachelanthamidine on the basis of spectral data. Apparently only two of the species included in this study, Ipomoea cristulata and Ipomoea sloteri, are able to synthesize both, ipangulines as well as minalobines. Minalobine O could be isolated as a major alkaloid of I. cristulata, its structure has been established as 9-O-(erythro-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-tigloyloxy-butyryl)-(-)-trachelanthamidine on the basis of spectral data.},

Before mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2. h and reperfusion for 22. h, PNPS at the doses of 50, 100, and 200. mg/kg was administered once a day intragastrically for continuous 7 days. Oral administration of PNPS could significantly reduce the severity of neurological deficits, infarct volumes, cerebral edema, and neuronal death caused by MCAO in rats. Moreover, in the presence of PNPS, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio increased, but the level of cleaved caspase-3 reduced. Thus, these finding suggested that suppressing apoptosis through increasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio and evoking caspase-3 cascade should be potential mechanism by which PNPS exerts its neuroprotective function against focal cerebral I/R injury. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The introduction of the six-port switching value, instead of a sample loop, assured 100\% recovery from the first dimension to the second, and the injection volumes of the second dimension were not restricted. Two configurations were tested in this study. In the first mode, only one column was used in the second dimension and two 'heart-cutting' fractions were transported to the same second-dimensional column. In the second mode, two parallel columns were used in the second dimension and two fractions were transported to the two columns. Between the two configurations, the one with two second dimensional columns had double sample size, better resolution and one more purified compound. Both two-dimensional configurations consumed less solvent with even greater efficiency and shorter cycle time compared with conventional gradient methods. All of the isoflavonoids were isolated at high purities of greater than 95\% with yields of above 82\%. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {AIM: To study cerebral protective mechanism of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). METHODS: Cultured neurons of chick embryo cerebral hemisphere were used as an in vitro system for investigating the effects of PNS. The hypoxic cell damage of neurons cultured were induced by NaCN. The levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were determined with HPLC. PNS was added 30 min before, beginning or after hypoxia. RESULTS: PNS 50 and 100 mg L-1 retarded the break down of ATP of cultured neurons after 2-h hypoxia for 11.3 +/- 1.5 (P {$<$} 0.05) and 12.8 +/- 2.2 mumol/g protein (P {$<$} 0.01), respectively and accelerated the restoration of ATP during 30-min reoxygenation for 21.0 +/- 2.0 (P {$<$} 0.05) and 22.7 +/- 2.6 mumol/g protein (P {$<$} 0.01), respectively. PNS also reduced the release of creatine kinase (CK) from 75 +/- 8 kU L-1/g protein to 52 +/- 6 (P {$<$} 0.05) and 41 +/- 3 kU L-1/mg protein (P {$<$} 0.01), respectively and promoted the restoration of ATP of neurons 20 h after hypoxia when administered in the beginning of hypoxia from 13.0 +/- 0.9 mumol/g protein to 18.1 +/- 1.4 and 20.5 +/- 2.1 mumol/g protein (P {$<$} 0.01), respectively. PNS still promoted the restoration of ATP from 13.0 +/- 0.9 nmol/mg protein to 14.9 +/- 1.0 and 18.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg protein (P {$<$} 0.01), respectively and reduced (PNS 100 mg L-1) the CK release of neurons 20 h after hypoxia even when added in the recovery. CONCLUSION: The protection against hypoxic damage of PNS was related to improving energy metabolism, preserving the structural integrity of neurons},

Here we test the hypothesis by using the well-known abortion herb Achyranthes bidentata Blume (A. bidentata). Five compounds were separated from the herb root. Among them, ginsenoside Ro was the most potent in inhibiting embryonic implantation within non-cytotoxic concentrations. It specifically inhibited the metastatic dissemination capability of colon cancer cells HT29, including the migration and invasion ability, and their adhesion to human endothelium through inhibiting integrin αvβ6, MMP-2, MMP-9, and ERK phosphorylation by HT29. Pretreatment of nude mice with oral ginsenoside Ro followed by HT29 intravenous inoculation and 40-day oral ginsenoside Ro significantly prevented lung metastasis with downregulation of integrin αvβ6 and no toxicity. The present study firstly introduces the new conception of utilizing safe and effective abortion botanic medicines for CTC-based metastatic chemoprevention.}

Chen which could be found widely in Asia, can attenuate atherogenesis in vivo. This study was designed to examine the relationship of PNS with cholesterol ester in foam cells sourced from macrophages and the effect of PNS on the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Materials and methods: Foam cells sourced from macrophages were cultured with PNS. The content of cholesterol ester in foam cells was analyzed and expressions of ABCA1 and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting methods. Results: The results showed that PNS could significantly decrease the level of cholesterol ester in foam cells at middle and high dosages. The real-time PCR and western blotting assays indicated that the expression of ABCA1 was up-regulated by PNS in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis based on these results showed that the cholesterol ester level was negatively correlated with ABCA1 expression. Conclusions: As a result, we conclude that by up-regulating the expression of ABCA1, PNS could lower the cholesterol ester level, which resulted in the attenuation of the foam cell formation. This bioactivity might be associated with the special chemical structures of PNS that are similar to the natural agonist of LXRα. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Maintenance of normal lipid levels has implicated the involvement of genes induced by liver X receptor α (LXRα) and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). This study was designed to evaluate the hypolipidemic effects of n-butanol extract (NE3) of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen root on lipid homeostasis and investigate the possible mechanisms in animal experiments. In the transactivation assays, NE3 was identified as a dual FXR/LXRα agonist. Subsequently, Sprague-Dawley male rats on a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet were treated orally with NE3 or vehicle alone. As expected, the concentrations of serum TC, TG and LDL-C in rats treated with various concentrations of NE3 showed significant (P {$<$} 0.01) and dose-dependent decrease, respectively, accompanied with a significant (P {$<$} 0.01) and dose-dependent decrease in the concentration of hepatic TC and TG. Express-level analysis indicated that both LXRα target genes including ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8 and FXR target genes including ApoCII and SHP were significantly induced by NE3 (P {$<$} 0.01). Interestingly, LDLR mRNA level was significantly higher by NE3 (P {$<$} 0.01), accompanied with the significantly decreased expression levels of CYP7A1, ApoCIII and SREBP1c genes (P {$<$} 0.01). Based on these results, it can be concluded that NE3 as a dual FXR/LXRα agonist largely prevented the accumulation of abnormal lipid in the hyperlipidemic rats. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(Arialiaceae) root (PN) is being used as a therapeutic agent to stop haemorrhages and as a tonic to promote health in Korean and Chinese medicine. The pharmacokinetic profiles of PN have not been accurately investigated. The preliminary aim was to elucidate the pharmacokinetic features of PN. First, the prevention of neutrophil functions was assessed. PN inhibited neutrophil functions, including degranulation, superoxide generation and leukotriene B4 production, without any effect on 5-lipoxygenase activity. PN reduced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG)E2 production in mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) while no influence on the activity of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) or cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) was observed. PN significantly reduced mouse paw oedema induced by carrageenan. The results indicate that PN exerts anti-inflammatory effects related to the inhibition of neutrophil functions and NO and PGE2 production, which could be due to a decreased expression of iNOS and COX-2.

  abstract = {(Received October 8, 2004) Free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by UV exposure or other environ- mental factors are critical players in cellular damage and aging. In order to develop a new anti- photoaging agent, this work focused on the antioxidant effects of the extract of tinged autum- nal leaves of Acer palmatum. One compound was isolated from an ethyl acetate soluble frac- tion of the A. palmatum extract using silica gel column chromatography. The chemical structure was identified as apigenin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside, more commonly known as vitexin, by spectral analysis including LC-MS, FT-IR, UV, \textasciitilde H-, and 13C-NMR. The biological activities of vitexin were investigated for the potential application of its anti-aging effects in the cosmetic field. Vitexin inhibited superoxide radicals by about 70\% at a concentration of 100 \#g/mL and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals by about 60\% at a concentration of 100 \#g/mL. Intracellular ROS scavenging activity was indicated by increases in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence upon exposure to UVB 20 mJ/cm 2 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) after the treatment of vitexin. The results show that oxidation of 5-(6-)chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlo- rodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) is inhibited by vitexin effectively and that vitexin has a potent free radical scavenging activity in UVB-irradiated HDFs. In ROS imaging using a confocal microscope we visualized DCF fluorescence in HDFs directly. In conclusion, our find- ings suggest that vitexin can be effectively used for the prevention of UV-induced adverse skin reactions such as free radical production and skin cell damage.},

  abstract = {The spectroscopic properties of 18 strongly hydrogen-bonded pyridine-benzoic acid adducts have been correlated with the ApK value of the complex. As the critical DpK for proton transfer is approached from either side of the critical region, increased broadening of the n-NH or n-OH and n-C=O bands is observed. Also, strong background absorption below 1200 cm-1 occurs. At the critical DpK value, discontinuous changes take place in the n-C=O and n-C-O regions of the spectrum, indicating that the adducts are either predominantly ionized or are predominantly un-ionized. In all of the complexes, either no band above 1700 cm-1 could be ascribed to n-OH or n-NH, or two bands near 1900-2000 and 2500-2600 cm-1 could be attributed to these modes. These two situations have been interpreted as corresponding to single-minimum- or near single-minimum-type and double-minimum-type hydrogen bonds, respectively. The single-minimum-type, hydrogen-bonded complex occurs only when its DpK is close to the critical DpK for proton transfer as determined from the n-C-O and n-C=O bands.},

We attempted to develop a chemically-induced hyperlipidemic mice model, using poloxamer-407 and evaluated the lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory effect of P. notoginseng compared with that of atorvastatin, an antihyperlipidemic drug. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group without any intervention (normal), poloxamer 500 mg/kg i.p. (P), poloxamer plus atorvastatin 1.34 mg/kg p.o. (P + ST), poloxamer plus P. notoginseng 40 mg/kg p.o. (P + NG40), and poloxamer plus P. notoginseng 100 mg/kg p.o. (P + NG100). After 3 weeks, we measured serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride, interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels, and reports of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 \& intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) appearances in each group. Results: After 3 weeks, serum cholesterol levels significantly decreased in P + ST and P + NG40 groups. Significant decrease of LDL level was only noted in the P + ST group. P + ST, P + NG40, and P + NG100 also had decreased serum triglyceride levels; however, P + ST and P + NG40 showed no statistical difference of the triglyceride lowering effect. The results of IL-1 and TNF-α and the appearance of COX-2 and ICAM were statistically not different in each group. Conclusions: P. notoginseng 40 mg/kg showed significantly lowering effects on serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. We suggest a well-designed study showing the effects of regulating blood lipids with combined administration of P. notoginseng and statin-drug.},

The assay involved pressurized liquid extraction and quantification with the aid of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Extraction conditions were optimized with respect to solvent, temperature, and number of extraction cycles. The ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy assay was validated over a range of 20-5000ng/mL (R2 of 0.9908). A total of 29 papaya leaf samples were analyzed, and carpaine concentration in dry leaves was found to range from 0.02 to 0.31\%. No obvious dependence on geographic origin and leaf maturity was observed.},

  abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: The root of Panax notoginseng (PN) is commonly used to treat chronic liver disease with its therapeutic abilities to stop haemorrhage in the circulation, while the PN flower (PN-F) is largely unknown in the biological activities on inflammation and mechanisms of its actions. In this study, the pharmacologic effects of PN-F methanol extract on inflammation were investigated to address potential therapeutic or toxic effects in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage cells, RAW264.7 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Production of NO, PGE2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) in supernatant, the expression of iNOS, COX-2 and cytokines, the phosphorylation of MAPK molecules (ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK), and the activation of NF-kappaB in PN-F extract were assayed in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. RESULTS: PN-F extract significantly inhibited the productions of NO, PGE2, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta on the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In addition, PN-F extract suppressed the mRNA and protein expressions of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The molecular mechanism of PN-F extract-mediated attenuation in RAW264.7 cells has close a relationship to suppressing the phosphorylation of MAPK molecules such as ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK, and the translocation of NF-kappaB p65 subunit into nuclear.

The zone of color retention was 14.2\,mm in β-carotene bleaching assay, which was as significant as positive control, butylated hydroxy toluene. None of the tested extracts possessed any hemolytic activity against rat and human erythrocytes revealing their cytotoxic mechanism and non-toxicity. Thus, only the ethanol extract could be considered as a potential source of anticancer and antioxidant compounds.

In this study, we found that in isolated rat islets adenovirus-mediated overexpression of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine pathway, leads to deterioration of β-cell function, which is similar to that found in diabetes. Overexpression of GFAT or treatment with glucosamine results in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduction in the expression levels of several β-cell specific genes (insulin, GLUT2, and glucokinase). Additionally, the DNA binding activity of PDX-1, an important transcription factor for these three genes, was markedly reduced. These phenomena were not mimicked by the induction of O-linked glycosylation with an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, PUG-NAc. It was also found that glucosamine increases hydrogen peroxide levels and that several hexosamine pathway-mediated changes were suppressed by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. In conclusion, activation of the hexosamine pathway leads to deterioration of β-cell function through the induction of oxidative stress rather than O-linked glycosylation. Thus, the hexosamine pathway may contribute to the deterioration of β-cell function found in diabetes.}

  abstract = {This study investigated the anti-allodynic and anti-oedematogenic effects of the hexanic extract, lignan-rich fraction and purified lignans from a plant used in the traditional medicine, Phyllanthus amarus, in the inflammatory and neuropathic models of nociception. The hexanic extract inhibited the allodynia and the oedema induced by the intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The inhibition observed was 76±7\% (ipsilateral paw), 64±7\% (contralateral paw), and 41±2\% (oedema). Otherwise, the lignan-rich fraction or the pure lignans did not affect CFA-induced allodynia. Administered chronically, the lignan fraction reduced CFA-induced paw oedema (39±9\%). When evaluated in the model of neuropathic pain caused by partial ligation of sciatic nerve, the hexanic extract inhibited the mechanical allodynia (77±7\%), with a similar efficacy to the gabapentin (71±10\%). The anti-allodynic effects of hexanic extract of P. amarus seem not to be associated with the impairment of motor co-ordination or with the development of tolerance. Finally, the treatment with hexanic extract inhibited the increase of myeloperoxidase activity, either following intraplantar injection of CFA or after sciatic nerve injury. It is concluded that, apart from its anti-inflammatory actions, which are probably linked to the presence of lignans, another as yet unidentified active principle(s) present in the hexanic extract of P. amarus produces pronounced anti-allodynia in two models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Considering that few drugs are currently available for the treatment of chronic pain, especially of the neuropathic type, the present results may have clinical relevance and open new possibilities for the development of new anti-allodynic drugs. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the extracts obtained from Phyllanthus amarus, and some of the lignans isolated from it, exhibit pronounced antiinflammatory properties. In the present study, we have assessed whether the antiinflammatory actions of these lignans can be mediated by interaction with platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor or interference with the action of this lipid. The local administration of nirtetralin, phyltetralin or niranthin (30~nmol/paw), similar to WEB2170 (a PAF receptor antagonist, 30~nmol/paw), significantly inhibited PAF-induced paw oedema formation in mice. The extracts of P. amarus (100~μg/ml) and niranthin (30~μM), but not nirtetralin or phyltetralin (30~μM), decreased the specific binding of [3H]-PAF in mouse cerebral cortex membranes. Furthermore, both niranthin and WEB2170 displaced, in a concentration-dependent manner, the [3H]-PAF binding sites. The mean IC50values from these effects were 6.5~μM and 0.3~μM, respectively. Additionally, both niranthin and WEB2170 (30~nmol/paw) inhibited the increase of myeloperoxidase activity induced by PAF injection in the mouse paw. When assessed the mouse model of pleurisy induced by PAF, pretreatment with niranthin (100~μmol/kg, p.o.) or WEB2170 (1.7~μmol/kg, i.p.) significantly inhibited PAF-induced protein extravasations. Moreover, in the rat model of PAF-induced allodynia, both niranthin (30~nmol/paw) and WEB2170 (30~nmol/paw) treatment significantly inhibited PAF-induced allodynia. In addition, niranthin had a rapid onset and long-lasting antiallodynic action when compared with WEB2170. Collectively, the present findings suggest that niranthin exhibits antiinflammatory and antiallodynic actions which are probably mediated through its direct antagonistic action on the PAF receptor binding sites. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The HE, the LRF or nirtetralin also inhibited the increase of IL1-beta tissue levels induced by Cg. Furthermore, bradykinin (BK)-, platelet activating factor (PAF)- and endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced paw oedema were significantly inhibited by the HE or LRF while histamine- and substance P-induced paw oedema were unaffected.

  abstract = {In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) is a predictive mathematical model describing the relationship between an in vitro property and a relevant in vivo response. The main objective of an IVIVC is to serve as a surrogate for human bioequivalence (BE) studies, which may reduce the number of BE studies performed during the initial approval process as well as with certain scale-up and postapproval changes. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a regulatory guidance related to development, evaluation, and applications of IVIVC for extended-release (ER) oral dosage forms in September 1997. Despite the publication of this guidance, the deficiencies related to IVIVC are still identified by the Division of Bioequivalence in the process of Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) review. Thus, the main objective of this article is to present the most commonly occurring deficiencies associated with IVIVCs via selected case studies from the ANDAs for oral ER drug products only. We searched internal FDA databases from January 1996 to December 2014 to identify the ANDAs for proposed generic oral ER drug products containing IVIVC. Only 14 ANDA submissions had IVIVC data, and most were not acceptable. Only one ANDA submission included adequate information related to IVIVC data enabling the completion of BE review within first review cycle. It is hoped that awareness of the deficiencies presented in our article would help the generic drug applicants to submit complete and appropriate information related to IVIVC data, ultimately, resulting in a more timely approval of ANDAs.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED Clinical diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the use of prescription medications for its treatment have increased in recent years. Current treatments may involve the administration of amphetamine-type substances, a treatment path many parents are apprehensive to take. Therefore, alternative pharmacological treatments are required. Few nutritional or pharmacological alternatives that reduce ADHD associated symptoms (hyperactivity and inattention) have been subjected to rigorous clinical trials. Bacopa monnieri is a perennial creeping herb. CDRI 08 is a special extract of Bacopa monnieri which has been subjected to hundreds of scientific studies and has been shown in human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve memory, attention, and mood. It is hypothesised that chronic administration of CDRI 08 will improve attention, concentration and behaviour in children with high levels of hyperactivity and/or inattention. This paper reports the protocol for the first 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel groups trial examining the efficacy and safety of CDRI 08 in male children aged 6-14 years with high levels of inattention and hyperactivity. The primary outcome variable will be the level of hyperactivity and inattention measured by the Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS). Secondary outcome variables include cognition, mood, sleep, and EEG. TRIAL REGISTRATION Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12612000827831.},

  abstract = {Background: Extracts of several members of the monoterpene-rich Lamiaceae sub-family Nepetoideae, including those from the Salvia (sage), Melissa (Lemon balm) and Rosmarinus (rosemary) genera, evince cognitive and mood effects in humans that are potentially related to their effects on cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. To date, despite promising in vitro properties, the cognitive and mood effects of the closely related Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha piperita (peppermint) remain unexplored. This study therefore assessed the human cognitive/mood effects of the M. spicata/piperita essential oil with the most promising, brain-relevant in vitro properties according to pre-trial in vitro screening. Design: Organic spearmint and peppermint (Mentha spicata/piperita) essential oils were pre-screened for neurotransmitter receptor binding and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over study, 24 participants (mean age 25.2 years) consumed single doses of encapsulated placebo and 50 µl and 100 µl of the most promising essential oil (peppermint with nicotinic/GABAA receptor binding and AChE inhibitory properties, that increased calcium influx in a CAD cell neuronal model). Psychological functioning was assessed with mood scales and a range of standardised, cognitively demanding tasks pre-dose and at 1, 3 and 6 h post-dose. Results: The highest (100 µL) dose of essential oil improved performance on the cognitively demanding Rapid Visual Information Processing task (RVIP) at 1 h and 3 h post-dose and both doses attenuated fatigue and improved performance of the Serial 3 s subtraction task at 3 h post-dose. Conclusion: Peppermint (Mentha piperita) essential oil with high levels of menthol/menthone and characteristic in vitro cholinergic inhibitory, calcium regulatory and GABAA/nicotinic receptor binding properties, beneficially modulated performance on demanding cognitive tasks and attenuated the increase in mental fatigue associated with extended cognitive task performance in healthy adults. Future investigations should consider investigating higher doses.},

Recent publications describing anticancer activity of crude and purified soybean saponins have sparked a renewed interest in these compounds. In this review, I summarize the epidemiological studies concerning the cancer protective effects of soy and the efforts to elucidate the constituents responsible for this effect. The recent reports of the anticancer activity of soy saponins is placed in context with reports of promising anticancer activity of structurally related non-dietary saponins from other legumes. While recent studies have demonstrated a direct effect of soy saponins on cancer cells, alternative mechanisms of cancer prevention by these agents are also discussed. It is concluded that the soy saponins may represent promising leads both in terms of elucidating the soy constituents involved in the cancer protective effect of soy as well as in the discovery of anticancer agents with novel mechanisms of action.},

  abstract = {Recently, the use of herbal medicines has been increased all over the world due to their therapeutic effects and fewer adverse effects as compared to the modern medicines. However, many herbal drugs and herbal extracts despite of their impressive in-vitro findings demonstrates less or negligible in-vivo activity due to their poor lipid solubility or improper molecular size, resulting in poor absorption and hence poor bioavailability. Nowadays with the advancement in the technology, novel drug delivery systems open the door towards the development of enhancing bioavailability of herbal drug delivery systems. For last one decade many novel carriers such as liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, transferosomes, ethosomes, lipid based systems etc. have been reported for successful modified delivery of various herbal drugs. Many herbal compounds including quercetin, genistein, naringin, sinomenine, piperine, glycyrrhizin and nitrile glycoside have demonstrated capability to enhance the bioavailability. The objective of this review is to summarize various available novel drug delivery technologies which have been developed for delivery of drugs (herbal), and to achieve better therapeutic response. An attempt has also been made to compile a profile on bioavailability enhancers of herbal origin with the mechanism of action (wherever reported) and studies on improvement in drug bioavailability, exhibited particularly by natural compounds. © 2013 Asian Pacific Tropical Biomedical Magazine.},

  abstract = {The degradation behavior of mangiferin, under various ICH Q1A(R2) recommended stress conditions, was studied using an isocratic elution with mobile phase (pH 2.4), composed of acetonitrile and 1\% orthophosphoric acid (12:88 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with λmax 262 nm. It was suitably adapted for LC–MS studies by replacing with 1\% acetic acid (ACN–1\% acetic acid; 18:82) and the pH was adjusted to 3.0. Extensive degradation was found to occur during alkaline medium stress studies at 2.31 min of retention time at λmax of 235 nm. The mass spectrum of mangiferin, 3 h after treatment with 0.1 M NaOH, clearly shows the rupture of the tricyclic ring, indicating that a fragment at m/z − 269 was formed. Furthermore, the results were supported by nuclear magnetic resonance as well. However, no degradation was observed in other stress conditions.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that drug discovery often requires a systems-level polypharmacology approach to tackle problems such as lack of efficacy and emerging resistance of single-targeted compounds. Network pharmacology approaches are increasingly being developed and applied to find new therapeutic opportunities and to re-purpose approved drugs. However, these recent advances have been relatively slow to be translated into the field of natural products. Here, we argue that a network pharmacology approach would enable an effective mapping of the yet unexplored target space of natural products, hence providing a systematic means to extend the druggable space of proteins implicated in various complex diseases. We give an overview of the key network pharmacology concepts and recent experimental-computational approaches that have been successfully applied to natural product research, including unbiased elucidation of mechanisms of action as well as systematic prediction of effective therapeutic combinations. We focus specifically on anticancer applications that use in vivo and in vitro functional phenotypic measurements, such as genome-wide transcriptomic response profiles, which enable a global modelling of the multi-target activity at the level of the biological pathways and interaction networks. We also provide representative examples of other disease applications, databases and tools as well as existing and emerging resources, which may prove useful for future natural product research. Finally, we offer our personal view of the current limitations, prospective developments and open questions in this exciting field.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: Phyllanthus amarus is a herbal medicine traditionally applied in the treatment of viral hepatitis. Aim of this study was to investigate potential anti-inflammatory properties of standardized P. amarus extracts concerning a potential influence of P. amarus on endotoxin-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Investigations were performed in rat Kupffer cells (KC), in RAW264.7 macrophages, in human whole blood, and in mice. Cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the presence or absence of P. amarus extracts (hexane, EtOH/H2O), mice were treated with galactosamine/LPS as a model for acute toxic hepatitis. Nitrite was measured by Griess assay, prostaglandin E2(PGE2) by radioimmunoassay, and cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. iNOS and COX-2 were determined by Western blot, activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by EMSA. Results: P. amarus EtOH/H2O and hexane extracts showed an inhibition of LPS-induced production of NO and PGE2in KC and in RAW264.7. The extracts also attenuated the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α in RAW264.7 as well as in human whole blood. Both extracts reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 and inhibited activation of NF-κB, but not of AP-1. P. amarus inhibited induction of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and interferon-γ in human whole blood and reduced TNF-α production in vivo. Conclusions: This work shows that standardized extracts of P. amarus inhibit the induction of iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α. Therefore, we report for the first time an anti-inflammatory potential of this traditionally employed herbal medicine both in vitro and in vivo. © 2002 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

J. Pharmacol. 135 (2002) 1281-1291]. In the present study, we examined the anti-amnestic activities of phenylpropanoids in mice with amnesia induced in vivo by scopolamine. Among the phenylpropanoids tested through passive avoidance tasks, buergeriside A1, buergeriside C1, E-p-methoxycinnamic acid (E-p-MCA) and E-isoferulic acid significantly improved the deficit of memory induced by scopolamine. This suggested that the α,β-unsaturated carboxyl moiety and the para-methoxy group in phenylpropanoids (E-p-MCA) might be a crucial component in their cognition-enhancing activity. Indeed, E-p-MCA (0.01-2 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), given in pre- or post-treatment paradigms, significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced amnesia as determined by passive avoidance tasks and prevented or aided in the recovery of memory to a level that was about 60\% of control. In addition, E-p-MCA (0.1-1.0 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) significantly improved impairments of spatial learning and memory induced by scopolamine; the compound reduced deficits in both long- and short-term memories as measured by the Morris water maze test. We suggest, therefore, that E-p-MCA may ultimately hold significant therapeutic value in alleviating certain memory impairments observed in dementia. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

Therefore, we investigated the anti-NASH effects of the water extract of A. iwayomogi (AI), C. longa radix (CL), and combination of the two herbs (ACE). Hepatic steatosis and NASH were induced in HepG2 cells by treatment with palmitic acid (PA, for 6 h) with/without pretreatment of ACE (25 or 50 μ g/mL), AI (50 or 100 μ g/mL), CL (50 or 100 μ g/mL), curcumin (5 μ g/mL), or scopoletin (5 μ g/mL). The PA treatment (200 μ M) drastically altered intracellular triglyceride levels, total cholesterol, and expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism (CD36, SREBP1c, PPAR- γ , and PPAR- α ), whereas pretreatment with ACE significantly attenuated these alterations. ACE also protected HepG2 cells from PA- (300 μ M-) induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis and attenuated the related key molecules including GRP78, eIF2, and CHOP, respectively. In conclusion, we found synergic effects of A. iwayomogi and C. longa on NASH, supporting the clinical potential for fatty liver disorders. In addition, modulation of ER stress-relative molecules would be involved in its underlying mechanism.}

These ginsengs contain saponins, which can be classified as dammarane-type, ocotillol-type and oleanane-type oligoglycosides, and polysaccharides as main constituents. Dammarane ginsenosides are transformed into compounds such as the ginsenosides Rg3, Rg5, and Rk1 by steaming and heating and are metabolized into metabolites such as compound K, ginsenoside Rh1, protoand panaxatriol by intestinal microflora. These metabolites are nonpolar, pharmacologically active and easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, the activities metabolizing these constituents into bioactive compounds differ significantly among individuals because all individuals possess characteristic indigenous strains of intestinal bacteria. To overcome this difference, ginsengs fermented with enzymes or microbes have been developed.},

Immunofluorescence imaging and analysis have revealed that 50 and 100 microg/ml of SPN increased GLUT4 in the plasma membrane by 3-fold and 6-fold respectively (p {$<$} 0.001). Furthermore, the incorporation of D-[U-(14)C] glucose into glycogen was enhanced by 53\% in 3T3-L1 cells treated with 100 microg/ml of SPN (p {$<$} 0.01 vs. insulin stimulation alone).

  abstract = {Compelling evidence indicates that polyphenolic antioxidants protect against diabetic nephropathy. Pycnogenol is made up of flavonoids, mainly procyanidins and phenolic compounds, and is a known powerful antioxidant. Hyperglycemia is characteristic of diabetic nephropathy and induces renal tubular cell apoptosis. Thus, in this study, we used high glucose-treated renal tubular cells to investigate the protective action of pycnogenol against high glucose-induced apoptosis and diabetic nephropathy. We also sought to further delineate the underlying mechanisms elicited by oxidative stress and inflammation and suppressed by pycnogenol. Results show that pycnogenol significantly suppressed the high glucose-induced morphological changes and the reduction in cell viability associated with cytotoxicity. Bcl2/Bax protein levels indicated pycnogenol's anti-apoptotic effect against high glucose-induced apoptotic cell death. In addition, several key markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were measured for pycnogenol's beneficial effects. Results indicate pycnogenol's anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory efficacy in suppressing lipid peroxidation, total reactive species (RS), superoxide ( O 2), nitric oxide (NO ), peroxynitrite (ONOO -), pro-inflammatory inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation. Based on these results, we conclude that pycnogenol's anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties underlie its anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting further investigation of pycnogenol as a promising treatment against diabetic nephropathy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study we investigated whether scopoletin caused apoptosis in HL-60 promyelocytic cells and, if so, by what mechanisms. We found that scopoletin induced apoptosis as confirmed by a characteristic ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments in a dose-dependent manner. The signal cascade activated by scopoletin included the heterodimeric redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, which exhibited an upregulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) translocation to the nucleus by increase of IκBα degradation. In addition, scopoletin activated caspase-3 as was evidenced by both the proteolytic cleavage of the proenzyme and increased protease activity. Activation of caspase-3 resulted in the cleavage of 116 kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) to 85 kDa cleavage product in time-and dose-dependent fashions. Prior treatment of the cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation, or Ac-DEVD-CHO, a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, prevented scopoletin-induced caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and finally DNA fragmentation. Taken together, these results suggest that scopoletin induces NF-κB activation, which, in turn, causes activation of caspase-3, degradation of PARP, and eventually leads to apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {To identify novel cosmetic ingredients from subtropical plants, we screened 21 parts of 12 plant species collected from the Agricultural Research Institute for Climate located in Jeju Island, the southernmost island of the Korean Peninsula. Subtropical plants were investigated for their total polyphenolic content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with gallic acid as the standard as well as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) scavenging activities. In both the DPPH and the ABTS assays, three plants, Syzygium samarangense, Acca sellowiana (leaves and branches), and Olea europaea (branches) showed significantly greater scavenging activity [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) {$<$} 50 μg/mL] than the other plants did. The leaves and branches of S. samarangense also had the highest total phenolic content (153.7 and 160.6 mg gallic acid equivalent [GAE]/g DW, respectively). However, the subtropical plants in this study showed lower elastase and tyrosinase inhibition activities than the positive controls oleanolic acid and arbutin (95.0 and 86.5 μg/mL, respectively) did. Furthermore, we sought to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of these subtropical plants for potential use in topical applications to treat skin inflammation. Therefore, they were screened for inhibitory effects on the proinflammatory mediator, nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Our results revealed that S. samarangense leaves potently inhibited the LPS-stimulated NO production concentration-dependently with an IC50 of 154.3 μg/mL. These results suggest that these subtropical plants possess several biological activities that may be potent inhibitors of the skin aging and inflammatory processes. Further investigations will focus on cell-based in vitro assays and chemically identifying the major active components mediating the anti-aging and anti-inflammation.},

Our previous studies found that mangiferin could decrease serum FFA levels in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet. Our research was to determine the effects and mechanism of mangiferin on improving IR by regulating FFA metabolism in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. The model was used to quantify PA-induced lipid accumulation in the two cell lines treated with various concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h. We found that mangiferin significantly increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, via phosphorylation of protein kinase B (P-AKT), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein expressions, and markedly decreased glucose content, respectively, in HepG2 and C2C12 cells induced by PA. Mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake and decreased intracellular FFA and triglyceride (TG) accumulations. The activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR α ) protein and its downstream proteins involved in fatty acid translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the fatty acid β -oxidation rate corresponding to FFA metabolism were also markedly increased by mangiferin in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. Furthermore, the effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of PPAR α . Mangiferin ameliorated IR by increasing the consumption of glucose and promoting the FFA oxidation via the PPAR α pathway in HepG2 and C2C12 cells.}

Initial mass spectral data suggested it to be a pyrrolizidine conjugate. As this class of alkaloids has not been described before from grasses, we isolated it to elucidate its structure. The isolated alkaloid proved to be a mixture of two stereoisomers. The structures of the two compounds as determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, were E-thesinine-O-4′-α-rhamnoside (1) and Z-thesinine-O-4′-α-rhamnoside (2). These identifications were supported by the characterisation by GC-MS and optical rotation of (+)-isoretronecanol as the necine base released on alkaline hydrolysis of these alkaloids. 1 and 2 together with the aglycone and a hexoside were also detected in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).

  abstract = {▪ Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Identifying bioactive compounds and establishing their health effects are active areas of scientific inquiry. There are exciting prospects that select bioactive compounds will reduce the risk of many diseases, including chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Recent findings have established that cardiovascular disease is a disease of inflammation, and consequently is amenable to intervention via molecules that have anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, research demonstrating adverse effects of oxidants on atherogenesis raises the possibility that antioxidants can confer cardioprotective effects. This review provides an overview of research approaches that can be used to unravel the biology and health effects of bioactive compounds. Because of the number of bioactive compounds and the diversity of likely biological effects, numerous and diverse experimental approaches must be taken to increase our understanding of the biology of bioactive compounds. Recognizing the complexity of this biology, sophisticated experimental designs and analytical methodologies must be employed to advance the field. The discovery of novel health effects of bioactive compounds will provide the scientific basis for future efforts to use biotechnology to modify/fortify foods and food components as a means to improve public health.},

Artichoke (Cynara scolymus L., Asteraceae) leaf extract (ALE), rich in antioxidants, has cholesterol-reducing effect. We investigated the effect of ALE on serum and hepatic lipid levels and pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in the liver and heart of hypercholesterolemic rats. Rats were fed on 4\% (w/w) cholesterol and 1\% cholic acid (w/w) supplemented diet for 1 month. ALE (1.5 g/kg/day) was given by gavage during the last 2 weeks. High cholesterol (HC) diet caused significant increases in serum and liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and diene conjugate (DC) levels in both tissues. Hepatic vitamin E levels and hepatic and cardiac glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities decreased, but superoxide dismutase and glutathione transferase activities, glutathione, and vitamin C levels remained unchanged due to HC diet. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and ratio of cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol decreased in ALE plus HC-treated rats, but liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels remained unchanged. Significant decreases in hepatic and cardiac MDA and DC levels and increases in hepatic vitamin E and GSH-Px activities were observed in ALE-treated hypercholesterolemic rats. Our results indicate that ALE decreases serum lipids and hypercholesterolemia-induced pro-oxidant state in both tissues. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.},

  abstract = {Codium fragile and Chondrus crispus are, respectively, green and red seaweeds which are abundant along the North Atlantic coasts. We investigated the chemical composition and antiviral activity of enzymatic extracts of C. fragile (CF) and C. crispus (CC). On a dry weight basis, CF consisted of 11\% protein, 31\% neutral sugars, 0.8\% sulfate, 0.6\% uronic acids, and 49\% ash, while CC contained 27\% protein, 28\% neutral sugars, 17\% sulfate, 1.8\% uronic acids, and 25\% ash. Enzyme-assisted hydrolysis improved the extraction efficiency of bioactive materials. Commercial proteases and carbohydrases significantly improved (p ≤ 0.001) biomass yield (40\%–70\% dry matter) as compared to aqueous extraction (20\%–25\% dry matter). Moreover, enzymatic hydrolysis enhanced the recovery of protein, neutral sugars, uronic acids, and sulfates. The enzymatic hydrolysates exhibited significant activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) with EC50 of  77.6–126.8 μg/mL for CC and 36.5–41.3 μg/mL for CF, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 ID50/cells without cytotoxity (1–200 μg/mL). The extracts obtained from proteases (P1) and carbohydrases (C3) were also effective at higher virus MOI of  0.01 ID50/cells without cytotoxity. Taken together, these results indicate the potential application of enzymatic hydrolysates of C. fragile and C. crispus in functional food and antiviral drug discovery.},

The chromatographic method was developed for rapid screening of phytochemicals using high-pressure liquid chromatography hyphenated with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS/MS). Fifty two compounds were identified and characterized out of which forty three phenolics and nine lignans were successfully characterized based on retention time, exact mass, molecular formula and their fragmentation patterns. Among them, six bioactive compounds namely phyllanthin, hypophyllanthin, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin, were further quantified in 3.6min by developing ultra high performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-MS/MS) method in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition mode. It was found that the calibration curves for all analytes showed good linearity (R2{$>$}0.9986) within the test ranges. The overall limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.18-1.82ng/mL and 0.44-3.82ng/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for intra- and inter-day precisions were below 1.12\% and 1.92\%, respectively. Remarkable differences were observed in contents of the bioactive compounds in all samples. Principle component analysis was used for samples discrimination obtained from different geographical locations. On the basis of PC scores, samples MP and WB were closer and lying in the same quadrant, while UP was much far apart.},

Since 1985, NO has been the subject of numerous research efforts and as a result, has been found to play a major role in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, immune, and central nervous systems. In addition, deranged NO synthesis is the basis for a number of pathophysiologic states, such as atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, pyloric stenosis, and the hypertension associated with renal failure. Traditional NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside and new pharmacologic NO adducts such as S-nitrosothiols may serve as exogenous sources of NO for the treatment of NO-deficient pathologic states. This review is an attempt to acquaint the surgical community with the fundamentals of NO biochemistry and physiology. Increased knowledge of its functions in normal homeostasis and pathologic states will enable physicians to better understand these disease processes and utilize new pharmacologic therapies.}

Thirty-two, 55, and 30 HW-extracts of them showed anti-HSV-1, anti-poliovirus, and anti-measles virus activities, respectively. Among the 32 HW-extracts with anti-HSV-1 activity, 3 HW-extracts had anti-HSV-1 activity alone and the others showed anti-HSV-1 activity with anti-poliovirus and/or anti-measles virus activities. The 32 HW-extracts were further examined for their therapeutic efficacies of HSV-1 infection in mice. The mice were infected cutaneously with HSV-1 and HW-extracts were orally administered three times daily. Twelve HW-extracts, currently used for the treatment of various diseases other than viral infection, were found to be significantly effective in limiting the development of skin lesions and/or in prolonging the mean survival times of HSV-1-infected mice. These results suggested that 12 of 142 HW-extracts that exhibited therapeutic efficacy in an animal infection model were possible candidates for anti-HSV-1 traditional medicine. © 1993.},

The xylanase exhibits a temperature optimum of 50 °C and a pH optimum between 5 and 6. It inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 10 μM, but does not affect translation in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system when tested up to 70 μM. The enzyme is adsorbed on CM-cellulose, Affi-gel blue gel and Mono S. Previously xylanases have been isolated from seeds and not from roots, and have not been demonstrated to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.},

  abstract = {Isoflavonoids are characteristic metabolites in legumes and an overwhelming number of reports concerning them come from the Leguminosae. Nevertheless, the spectrum of isoflavonoid producing taxa includes the representatives of four classes of multicellular plants, namely the Bryopsida, the Pinopsida, the Magnoliopsida and the Liliopsida. At least 59 non-leguminous families have been reported to produce isoflavones sensu lato; coumestans have been reported in 3 families, coumaronochromones in 3, pterocarpans in 9 and rotenoids in 8 families. Prenylated isoflavones have been found in 15 non-leguminous families and isoflavone dimers, heterodimers or oligomers in three families. More than two hundred different isoflavonoid aglycones have been reported in non-legumes altogether. The number of individual structures is even greater if the variety of glycosides are considered. Enzymology and genetics of isoflavonoid biosynthesis have been studied almost exclusively in legumes, with the exception of a few model plants (i.e. Beta vulgaris, Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum and Zea mays). The key step at the very beginning of the isoflavonoid metabolic pathway is the oxidation of flavanone connected with the migration of aryl moiety from C2 to C3 mediated by a CYP450 enzyme isoflavone synthase (IFS), which has been identified and cloned in multiple legumes and in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris, Chenopodiaceae). No information is available about the enzyme(s) responsible for the biosynthesis of isoflavonoid core in other taxa. Experimental data demonstrates the capability of numerous enzymes of non-legume origin to metabolize isoflavones as alternative substrates to other phenolics. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is caused by excessive oxidative damage and aging. The objective of this study was to investigate the anti-dementia effect of LCP fruit powder on amyloid β (Aβ)-induced Alzheimer’s mice. The composition of LCP essential oil was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In addition, the water maze was used to evaluate the learning and memorizing abilities of the mice. The concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, phosphorylated τ-protein, and the deposition of Aβ plaques in mouse brains were also assessed. The results showed that the main components of essential oils in LCP and d-limonene, neral, and geranial contents were 14.15\%, 30.94\%, and 31.74\%, respectively. Furthermore, oral administration with different dosages of LCP significantly decreased the escape time (21.25\textasciitilde 33.62 s) and distance (3.23\textasciitilde 5.07 m) in the reference memory test, and increased the duration time (26.14\textasciitilde 28.90 s) and crossing frequency (7.00\textasciitilde 7.88 times) in the target zone of probe test (p {$<$} 0.05). LCP also inhibited the contents of MDA and the phosphor-τ-protein from oxidative stress, reduced the brain atrophy by about 3\textasciitilde 8\%, and decreased the percentage of Aβ plaques from 0.44 to 0.05\%. Finally, it was observed that the minimum dosage of LCP fruit powder (LLCP, 30.2 mg/day) could prevent oxidative stress induced by Aβ and subsequently facilitate memory and learning deficits in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and cognitively impaired mice.},

  abstract = {The Phyllanthus amarus plant shows potential for treating hepatitis B virus. To define the mechanism of action of P. amarus, we used HepG2 2.2.15 cells, which support hepatitis B virus replication. P. amarus inhibited hepatitis B virus polymerase activity, decreased episomal hepatitis B virus DNA content and suppressed virus release into culture medium. To examine transcriptional control mechanisms, we used G26 hepatitis B virus transgenic mice, which produce serum HBsAg but neither HBcAg nor virion particles. When P. amarus was administered to transgenic mice, hepatic HBsAg mRNA levels decreased, indicating transcriptional or post-transcriptional down-regulation of the transgene. Increase in hepatitis B virus mRNA expression after stimulation of the glucocorticoid responsive element was also suppressed by P. amarus, suggesting involvement of the hepatitis B virus enhancer in this response. Disruption by P. amarus of hepatitis B virus polymerase activity, mRNA transcription and replication supports its role as an antiviral agent.}

The analysis was achieved on an Alltima C18 analytical column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d. 5 μm) using linear gradient elution of acetonitrile-0.1\% trifluoroacetic acid. The correlation coefficients of similarity were determined from the HPLC fingerprints, and they shared a close similarity. By using an online APCI-MS/MS, twenty phenols were identified. In addition, seven of these phenols including mangiferin, 7-O-methylmangiferin, tectoridin, resveratrol, tectorigenin, irigenin and irisflorentin were quantified by the validated HPLC-DAD method. These phenols are considered to be major constituents in Rhizoma Belamcandae, and are generally regarded as the index for quality assessment of this herb. This developed method by having a combination of chromatographic fingerprint and quantification analysis could be applied to the quality control of Rhizoma Belamcandae. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Fura-2 fluorescence technique was used to determine the intracellular free calcium concentration in neutrophils (Neu-[Ca2+]i).\textbackslash nRESULTS: At 12 h, PnS 60-240 mg.kg-1 i.p. reduced Neu counts, protein content [(7.7 +/- 1.3) to (4.4 +/- 1.4) g.L-1], and Din content [(1619 +/- 391) to (883 +/- 268) ng.L-1]; inhibited the PLA2 activity in exudate [(248 +/- 42) to (157 +/- 35) kU.L-1] in a dose-dependent manner. PnS 60, 120, and 240 mg.kg-1 lowered the level of Neu-[Ca2+]i with the inhibitory rate of 9.1\%, 33.2\%, and 39.4\%, respectively.\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: PnS has an obvious anti-inflammatory effect and its mechanisms are related to the inhibition of the Neu-[Ca2+]i level and PLA2 activity, and reduction of Din content.},

Thirty-five ICR mice were randomly divided into five groups with seven animals in each group, and orally administered daily for 4 days at a dose equivalent to 0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25 or 0.5 g of dried RAM, respectively. After that, the animals were subcutaneously immunized twice with FMDV vaccine at 2-week intervals. Blood samples were collected 3 weeks after boosting for measurement of FMDV-specific IgG titers and the IgG subclasses, lymphocyte proliferation as well as production IL-5 and IFN-??. Results indicated that serum FMDV-specific IgG titers and the IgG subclass responses were significantly enhanced in mice orally administered RAM at the dose of 0.25 or 0.5 g when compared with the control group (P {$<$} 0.05). Splenocyte proliferation in response to Con A and LPS and production of IL-5 and IFN-?? by splenocytes were also significantly enhanced (P {$<$} 0.05). Considering the immunomodulatory effect and safety of RAM demonstrated in this study, this herb deserves further investigation to evaluate its potential improvement of FMD vaccination in other animals such as pigs, goats and cattle. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Recently, it was revealed that the dysfunction of transmembrane Ca2+transport, results in an increase in intracellular Ca2+[Ca2+]i, which is involved in the process of atherosclerosis. We previously demonstrated that ginsenoside-Rd, a purified component from panax notoginseng, is a voltage-independent Ca2+channels blocker. In this study, we investigated the effects of ginsenoside-Rd on atherosclerosis and the underlying mechanisms in apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice and RAW264.7 cells. Atherosclerotic plaques were stained by Red oil O staining. Ca2+influx was measured by Fura-2 dyed Mn2+quenching. Intracellular cholesterol and uptake of lipid was assayed by enzymatic, fluorometric method and DiI-labeled Ox-LDL. Western blot was used to determine protein expression. We found that Ginsenoside-Rd (20 mg/kg/day. i.p.) significantly reduced the atherosclerotic plaque areas, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) uptake and thapsigargin and l-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG, membrane-permeable diacylglycerol analog)-induced Ca2+influx in macrophages from high-fat diet apoE-/-mice. In vitro, 20 μM ginsenoside-Rd significantly inhibited ox-LDL-induced foam cell formation and the increase of thapsigargin- and OAG-induced Ca2+influx. Ox-LDL induced an increase in scavenger receptor A (SR-A) expression, and ginsenoside-Rd inhibited this effect of ox-LDL significantly. The results suggest that ginsenoside-Rd prevents the development of atherosclerosis. The underlying mechanism may be related to the inhibition of Ca2+influx through voltage-independent Ca2+channels, resulting in the inhibition of SR-A activity and expression, followed by reductions of ox-LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In this investigation, besides the evaluation of inhibitory activities of twenty-three essential oils against Candida albicans          in vitro, identification and quantification of the chemical composition of Litsea cubeba essential oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were investigated. Further development, we assessed the mechanism of L. cubeba essential oil against C. albicans by molecular docking. Litsea cubeba essential oil displayed the strongest inhibitory activity among these oils and the diameter of the circle against C. albicans was more than 50 mm. Maximum three components were identified with trans-citral (33.6\%), cis-citral (30.3\%), d-limonene (8.2\%). Secretory aspartate protease (SAP5) and β-1,3-glucan synthase (β-1,3-GS) are two key enzyme proteins that inhibit the growth of C. albicans. Molecular docking studies reveal chemical binding forces of cis-citral, trans-citral and d-limonene to SAP5 are -21.76 kJ/mol, -22.18 kJ/mol and -24.27 kJ/mol, to β-1,3-GS are -23.01 kJ/mol, -25.52 kJ/mol and -23.85 kJ/mol, respectively. The most preferable binding mechanism was observed against SAP5 and β-1,3-GS due to hydrophobic interaction, as well as hydrogen bonding between citral molecules. The research results suggest the mechanism of chemical components in L. cubeba essential oil inhibits the growth of C. albicans, which provides a reference to the development and utilization of essential oil. 	 	graphical abstract 	Fullsize Image},

Anti-diabetes activities of isolated compounds were evaluated through their inhibitory activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) enzyme. Results and Conclusion: Three new dammarane-type triterpenoids, notoginsenoside-LX (1), notoginsenoside- LY (2), and notoginsenoside-FZ (3) together with eighteen known compounds were isolated from the Panax notoginseng leaves. The structure-activity relationship of the compounds with dammaranetype triterpenoids and their PTP1B inhibitory activity were also reported. Results showed that compounds 2, 15, 20, and 21 can significantly inhibit the enzyme activity of PTP1B in a dose-dependent manner, with inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values of 29.08 μM, 21.27 μM, 28.12 mM, and 26.59 μM, respectively. The results suggested that Panax notoginseng leaves might have potential as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes. © 2013, The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier.

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to systematically describe the factors affecting turbidity in beverage emulsions and to get a better understanding of visual perception of turbidity. The sensory evaluation of the human visual perception of turbidity showed that humans are most sensitive to turbidity differences between two samples in the range between 1000 and 1500 NTU (ratio) (nephelometric turbidity units). At very high turbidity values {$>~$}2000 TU in NTU (ratio) were needed to distinguish between samples that they were perceived significantly different. Particle size was the most important factor affecting turbidity. It was shown that a maximum turbidity occurs at a mean volume - surface diameter of 0.2~μm for the oil droplet size. Additional parameters were the refractive index, the composition of the aqueous phase and the presence of excess emulsifier. In a concentration typical for a beverage emulsion a change in the refractive index of the oil phase may allow the alteration of turbidity by up to 30\%. With the knowledge on visual perception of turbidity and the determining factors, turbidity can be tailored in product development according to the customer requirements and in quality control to define acceptable variations in optical appearance.},

Fifty mice were divided into fi ve equal groups with 10 in each group. Group 1 (control) received saline, whereas group 2 received ethanol (70\%, 0.1 mL, p.o.) once daily for 4 weeks, which induced hepatotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation of serum enzyme activities, such as SGOT and SGPT. Hepatotoxicity was further evidenced by a significant increase in the hepatic lipid peroxidation measured. Groups 3-5 were administered a hot water extract of PNG at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg 2 weeks after initiating oral administration of ethanol, for a further 2 weeks. PNG ameliorated the rise in serum sGOT and sGPT induced by chronic ethanol administration. The mice were killed after PNG administration. In a separate study, PNG inhibited the lipid peroxidation in the mouse liver homogenate induced by ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. The findings indicate that PNG is an efficient cytoprotective agent against chronic ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity, possibly through inhibition of the production of oxygen-free radicals that cause lipid peroxidation.},

In the discovery setting 'the rule of 5' predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, 10 H-bond acceptors, the molecular weight (MWT) is greater than 500 and the calculated Log P (CLogP) is greater than 5 (or MlogP {$>$} 4.15). Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

Materials and methods: Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model using the intraluminal thread. TSPN was administered intraperitoneally at 5 min before and 12 h, 24 h and 36 h after MCAO, respectively. Results: TSPN (at the dose of 25 mg/kg) significantly attenuated TUNEL-positive cells and reduced the expression of caspase-1 and caspase-3 compared to the model group, while it had no obvious effect on the expression of caspase-8. Conclusions: The neuroprotective effect of TSPN on focal ischemia may be related to inhibition of apoptosis and caspases activation. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Method: Chemical compositions of AEO were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The potential targets involved in the effect of AEO on anxiety were predicted by searching Bioinformatics databases. Cytoscape software was applied for networks construction. Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway was done via R Programming Language, while molecular docking analysis was conducted by Autodock vina software.  Results: Network analysis showed that there were 10 bioactive components and 34 potential targets. The potential targets were distributed in cerebellar cortex, basic ganglia, hippocampal formation, amygdala, pons and medulla and liver. AEO was involved in multiple biological processes (BP), cell components (CC) and molecular functions (MF) associated with anxiety disorder. Molecular docking revealed good binding affinity between the major bioactive components and targets.  Conclusion: This study has revealed the pharmacological mechanism involved in the effect of AEO on anxiety, through network pharmacology and molecular docking. The pharmacological mechanism provides a firm theoretical basis for further studies in this area of research.},

  abstract = {AIM To study protective effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PnS) against cisplatin-nephrotoxicity. METHODS Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice in vivo, and primary culture of rabbit proximal tubular cells (PTC) in vitro were established. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, cell viability, DNA interstrand cross-link, DNA-protein cross-link, and cytosolic free [Ca2+]i were assayed with diacetyl monoxime, alkaline picrate, trypan blue, ethidium bromide binding, 125I-postlabelling, and Fur 2-AM, respectively. RESULTS With pretreatment for 2 d in mice, PnS 100 and 200 mg.kg-1.d-1 suppressed cisplatin-induced high blood urea nitrogen level to 83\% and 31\%, and serum creatinine level to 86\% and 42\%, respectively (P {$<$} 0.01). Preincubated with PTC for 24 h, PnS 10 and 100 mg.L-1 inhibited cisplatin-induced decrease of cell viability from 78\% to 81\% (P {$<$} 0.05) and 89\% (P {$<$} 0.01), respectively. PnS 10 and 100 mg.L-1 suppressed formations of DNA interstrand cross-link to 47\% and 40\%, DNA-protein interstrand cross-link to 77\% and 42\%, and cytosolic free [Ca2+]i overload in PTC to 70\% and 63\%, respectively. (P {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSION PnS was a prophylactic for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, and mechanisms were relevant to the effects that PnS reduced cisplatin-induced cytosolic free [Ca2+]i overload, and formations of DNA interstrand cross-link and DNA-protein cross-link.}

The effects of PNS (120 mg/kg, once daily administrated intragastrically (i.g.)) on atherosclerosis induced by a high-cholesterol diet and chronic inflammation, which was derived through zymosan (10 mg/kg, once every 2 d) administration intraperitoneally, were evaluated in rabbits for 8 weeks. A normal group, a simple high-fat diet group, and a zymosan plus high-cholesterol diet group (Zym) were used as controls. Typical pathologic changes associated with atherosclerosis in rabbits following induction by zymosan were alleviated by PNS treatment. After 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment, PNS decreased the serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein as well as increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level significantly in comparison with those in the Zym group, except for triglycerides at week 2. In addition, PNS treatment significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of monocyte chemoattactant protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB/p65 in the aorta wall after 8 weeks of treatment compared with the Zym group. In conclusion, PNS attenuates atherogenesis through an antiinflammatory action and regulation of the blood lipid profile.},

  abstract = {Background: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from the bone marrow (BM) play a key role in the homeostasis of vascular repair by enhanced reendothelialization. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease. The present research was designed to explore the contribution of progenitor cells to the progression of atherosclerotic plaques and the possible modulatory role of PNS in this process. Methods: PNS (60 or 120 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection) was administered over 8 weeks in apolipoprotein E knockout mice on an atherogenic diet. The sizes and histochemical alteration of atherosclerotic lesions and numbers of EPCs in BM and peripheral blood were analyzed. The expression of chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor, CXCR4, was monitored as well. Results: PNS significantly reduced the lesion area and intima-to-media ratio compared to vehicle treatment. PNS also augmented endothelialization and reduced the smooth muscle cell (SMCs) content of the lesions. The number of c-kit and sca-1 double-positive progenitor cells and flk-1 and sca-1 double-positive progenitor cells were significantly increased in the BM and the peripheral blood of the PNS-treated groups. PNS treatment increased the plasma levels of SDF-1 and SCF as well as the BM levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, the mRNA levels of SDF-1 and protein levels of CXCR4 were both increased in the BM of mice treated with PNS, while SDF-1 expression decreased. Conclusion: PNS reduce the size of atherosclerotic plaques, and this effect appears to involve progenitor cell mobilization. SDF-1-CXCR4 interactions and the possible modulatory role of PNS in this process may contribute to the increased progenitor cell mobilization. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

The rats underwent intraperitoneal injection with a single dose of cisplatin, a subset of rats were also intraperitoneally injected with 31.35 mg/kg PNS once a day for 8 days. At day 1, 4 and 8 after exposure to cisplatin, the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-Glucosaminidase (NAG) were determined using commercial kits. The pathological change of renal tissue were examined using H \& E staining and transmission electron microscopy. The rate of apoptosis and the expression of Bcl-2 in rat renal tissue were detected by using TUNEL staining and Western bloting, respectively. And the expressions of Bax and caspases 9 were detected by immunnohistochemistry. The results showed that PNS significantly protected against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by the decrease in concentration of blood BUN, Scr and urinary NAG, as well as the attenuation of renal histopathological damage. Furthermore, PNS reduced the rate of apoptosis, and the mechanism studies showed that PNS inhibited the expression of Bax and caspase 9, while increased the expression of Bcl-2. This study first demonstrated that PNS can protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and reduce renal tissue apoptosis via inhibiting the mitochondrial pathway.},

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are known as the major pharmacologically active constituents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective effects of PNS against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and its possible influence on the anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin. Five groups of ICR mice were treated with saline (control group), doxorubicin alone (20 mg/kg I. P.), PNS alone, doxorubicin pretreated with PNS (100 mg/kg I. G. for 5 consecutive days) or amifostine (single dose of 200 mg/kg I. V., used as positive control). After 72 h of doxorubicin treatment, cardiac function, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and activities of antioxidant enzymes in heart tissue were measured. Pretreatment with PNS significantly protected the mice from DOX-induced cardiotoxicity as evidenced from improved ventricular contractile function, lower levels of serum LDH, CK and CK-MB, minimal morphological changes in hearts, and normalization of myocardial superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities. Additionally, IN VITRO cytotoxic studies demonstrated that PNS did not compromise the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on the proliferation of cancer cells. These results imply the potentially clinical application of PNS to overcome the negative side effects of doxorubicin.},

Changes of endotoxin, MPO, IL-6, SOD, MDA and TNF α were observed at 30 and 120 min of recovery stage by ELISA; water content of lung and intestine was detected; HE staining was applied to observe morphological change of intestinal mucosa, kidney, liver and lung; western blot was used to detect intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level in lung tissue and intestine tissue. At 30 min and 120 min of recovery stage, MDA, MPO, endotoxin, TNF α and IL-6 levels significantly increased in model group compared with control group, however SOD level significantly decreased, the difference was statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.05); PNS dose-dependently decreased MDA, MPO, endotoxin, TNF α and IL-6 levels, and increased SOD level, which was statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.05); In results of water content detection, water content in lung tissue and intestine tissue was significantly higher than in control group, however, after being treated with PNS, the water content was significantly decreased; HE staining showed the morphologic change of lung tissue cells; Western blot showed that in lung tissue and intestine tissue, ICAM-1 level in model group was significantly higher than in control group, and it was lower in PNS group than in model group. PNS can increase SOD activity, decrease levels of MDA, endotoxin and MPO, decrease expression of TNF α and IL-6, and decrease water content in lung tissue and intestine tissue. Thus, PNS is protective to rat hemorrhagic shock model by anti oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory pathways, and ICAM-1 may play an important role in the mechanism.},

METHODS Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) and HPLC-UV methods were developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of ginsenosides in PNL, respectively.  RESULTS Extraction conditions, including solvents and extraction methods, were optimized, which showed that ginsenosides Rc and Rb3, the main components of PNL, are transformed to notoginsenosides Fe and Fd, respectively, in the presence of water, by removing a glucose residue from position C-3 via possible enzymatic hydrolysis. A total of 57 saponins were identified in the methanolic extract of PNL by UPLC/Q-TOF MS. Among them, 19 components were unambiguously characterized by their reference substances. Additionally, seven saponins of PNL—ginsenosides Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rb3, and notoginsenosides Fc, Fe, and Fd—were quantified using the HPLC-UV method after extraction with methanol. The separation of analytes, particularly the separation of notoginsenoside Fc and ginsenoside Rc, was achieved on a Zorbax ODS C8 column at a temperature of 35°C. This developed HPLC-UV method provides an adequate linearity (r2{$>$}0.999), repeatability (relative standard deviation, RSD {$<$} 2.98\%), and inter- and intraday variations (RSD {$<$} 4.40\%) with recovery (98.7–106.1\%) of seven saponins concerned. This validated method was also conducted to determine seven components in 10 batches of PNL.  CONCLUSION These findings are beneficial to the quality control of PNL and its relevant products.},

Increasing evidences suggest that PNS have versatile effects against a variety of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), leading to four clinical trials completed and/or underway. There is a timely need to summarize our current understanding of these natural compounds. Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarize and critically appraise the latest literature (mainly since 2008), which study PNS as potential therapeutic agents against CVDs. Furthermore, they introduce the structures of major PNS types, analyze their cellular targets and associated signaling pathways and discuss the emerging opportunities for their clinical applications.

We investigated the effect of TPNS on serum lipid levels and cell differentiation antigen 40 (CD40) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) expression in atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (apoE-KO) mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Twenty-four apoE-KO mice were divided into two groups, the ApoE-KO group and the ApoE-KO + TPNS group. TPNS (60 mg/kg) was orally administered daily for 12 weeks in ApoE-KO + TPNS group. After 12 weeks, blood and aortas were obtained. Serum levels of lipid were analyzed, serum oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) concentration, ratio of plaque area-to-vessel area and the expression of CD40 and MMP-9 were examined by ELISA, histological staining, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR, respectively. It was observed in our study that serum levels of lipid and oxLDL, ratio of plaque area to vessel area, and expression of CD40 and MMP-9 were lower in the ApoE-KO + TPNS group than in the ApoE-KO group. These results suggest that TPNS could prevent atherosclerosis by lowering serum lipid levels and regulating vascular CD40 and MMP-9 expression. TPNS may have implications for clinical treatment of atherosclerosis vascular disease. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Essential oils have been used as remedies since ancient times for the treatment of numerous illnesses on account of their wide range of biological activities. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown varying pharmacological responses in the nervous system leading to anxiolytic, antidepressant, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects. Experimentation in animal models has evidenced the involvement of multiple neurotransmitter systems in the mode of action of essential oils, resulting in measurable physiological effects in the brain. Additionally, clinical trials have demonstrated the influence of essential oils in physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, brain waves composition, and cortisol serum levels with concomitant psychological effects. Although there is growing evidence of measurable effects of essential oils in animal brains, more clinical research is required to validate their influence in the human central nervous system. This will enable the development of essential oil-based drugs for the treatment of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and dementia.},

The antioxidant activity of some of its principal constituents, namely amariin, 1-galloyl-2,3-dehydrohexahydroxydiphenyl (DHHDP)-glucose, repandusinic acid, geraniin, corilagin, phyllanthusiin D, rutin and quercetin 3-O-glucoside were examined for their ability to scavenge free radicals in a range of systems including 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS)/ferrylmyoglobin, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and pulse radiolysis. In addition, their ability to protect rat liver mitochondria against oxidative damage was determined by measuring the ROO* radical induced damage to proteins and lipids and *OH radical induced damage to plasmid DNA. The compounds showed significant antioxidant activities with differing efficacy depending on the assays employed. Amariin, repandusinic acid and phyllanthusiin D showed higher antioxidant activity among the ellagitannins and were comparable to the flavonoids, rutin and quercetin 3-O-glucoside.},

One hundred and thirty-six endophytes were isolated and screened for their biotransformational abilities. The results showed that five of the tested endophytes were able to transform these saponins. These five strains were identified based on their ITS or 16S rDNA sequences, which revealed that they belonged to the genera Fusarium, Nodulisporium, Brevundimonas, and Bacillus genera. Ten transformed products were isolated and identified, including a new compound 6-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1--{$>$}2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-20-O-beta-D-glucopyra nosyldammarane-3,6,12,20,24,25-hexaol (3), and nine known compounds, compound K (1), ginsenoside F2 (2), vinaginsenoside R13 (4), vinaginsenoside R22 (5), pseudo-ginsenoside RT4 (6), (20S)-protopanaxatriol (7), ginsenoside Rg1 (8), vinaginsenoside R15 (9), and (20S)-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-6-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylprotopanaxatriol (10).

High-performance gel permeation chromatography analysis showed that the average molecular sizes of TIP1-1 and TIP2-1 were approximately 1.75×10 4 Da and 5.73×10 3 Da, respectively. Monosaccharide component analysis by gas chromatography indicated that TIP1-1 was composed of mannose, glucose, galactose, and rhamannose in the respective molar ratio of 3.93:1.24:0.75:1.26 and that TIP2-1 contained mannose, glucose, and arabinose in the respective molar ratio of 5.27:1.44:0.43. The antioxidant activity analyses revealed that TIP1-1 and TIP2-1 possessed considerable antioxidant activity. Compared with TIP1-1, which has a higher molecular weight and contains no uronic acid, TIP2-1 exhibited a protective effect on PC12 cells injured by H 2O 2 and a higher scavenging activity against free radicals. The relative effects of the lower molecular size, the presence of uronic acid, and the antioxidant activity of TIP2-1 appear to be significant. Accordingly, the Chinese truffle T. indicum might serve as an effective antioxidative healthcare food and source of natural antioxidants. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.},

Materials and methods: Using PC12 cells and Kunming mice, we test thioredoxin-1 expression after PTS treatment by Western blot. The protective effect of PTS against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion-induced injury was assessed by MTT assay and LDH release assay. Results: PTS induced thioredoxin-1 expression in vitro and in vivo, and attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion-induced cell death of PC12 cells. Conclusions: PTS is a new inducer of thioredoxin-1 and has a possible potential as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The medicinal plants selected were leaves of Apium graveolens (saderi), Averrhoa bilimbi (belimbing buluh), Centella asiatica (pegaga), Mentha arvensis (pudina), Psidium guajava (jambu batu), Sauropus androgynous (cekor manis), Solanum nigrum (terung meranti) and Polygonum minus (kesum ). Results revealed that both type and conditions of the drying treatments affected retention of all phytochemicals analysed. Herbal preparation developed using oven drying was found to have inferior phytochemicals content compared to that obtained by freeze dryer. Nevertheless, the herbal preparation developed using all treatments still retain appreciable amount of phytochemicals studied, especially carotenoids, ascorbic acid, niacin and riboflavin and thus have potential for commercial purposes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Anxiety disorders are some of the most common psychiatric disorders, with potentially debilitating consequences on individual function. Existing pharmacotherapies for anxiety disorders are limited by delay to therapeutic effect, dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, and abuse potential. Therefore, safe and evidence-based complementary or alternative therapies may be important allies in the care of patients with anxiety disorders. Essential oils are lipophilic and concentrated botanical extracts that exhibit many properties of drugs, although they are not Food and Drug Administration approved and have limitations characteristic of herbal preparations. Lavender essential oil has an extensive anecdotal history of anxiolytic benefit that has recently been supported by clinical efficacy studies. The 2 primary terpenoid constituents of lavender essential oil, linalool and linalyl acetate, may produce an anxiolytic effect in combination via inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, reduction of 5HT1A receptor activity, and increased parasympathetic tone. The objectives of this article are to provide a brief overview of lavender oil in aromatherapy, explore variability in the constituents of lavender oil, summarize its pharmacology and safety profile, as well as describe its body of research that has been conducted for anxiety.},

Background: Phyltetralin (1) and phyllanthin (2) are two potent anti-hyperuricemic lignans in the standardized Phyffanthus niruri extract (PNF5) yet displayed low oral bioavailability in rats. Objective: The purposes of the current study were to investigate the contributing factors towards the poor bioavailabilities of the lignans in PNF5 and increase the bioavailability by developing a formulation method, which can specifically overcome these contributing factors. Materials and Methods: Aqueous solubility, pH stability, P-glycoproteins efflux and first-pass metabolism of 1 and 2 in PNF5 were evaluated accordingly using in vitro methods. The PNF5 was subsequently formulated as Gelucire®44/14-based solid dispersion capsules (PNF5-SDC) and the oral bioavailabilities of 1 and 2 in PNF5-SDC were estimated compared to that of the conventional PN F5 powder filled capsules (PNF5-PFC). Results: The study shown that the solubility of PNF5 was 0.12±0.02 mg mL -1 , pH value of GIT lumen were not significant affected the lignans absorption (p {$>$} 0.05). The in vitro absorption of lignans significantly improved by combination with P-glycoprotein inhibitors: Verapamil (p {$<$} 0.001) and quinidine(p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, there were no significant variation for the amount of 1 (p = 0.4363) and 2 (p = 0.5396) and no metabolites were observed when PNF5 incubated with homogenized liver. Moreover, the relative oral bioavailability of the lignans in PNF5-SDC was increased by 3 fold (p {$<$} 0.05), higher than those in PNF5-PFC when orally administered in rats. Conclusion: The results suggest that the poor bioavailability of 1 and 2 was due mainly to its poor aqueous solubility and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux. Gelucire®44/14-based solid dispersion could significant improve the bioavailability of lignans.},

(Combretaceae) frequently appear in many Thai Lanna medicinal plant recipes for promoting longevity. Objectives: To investigate the in vitro anti-aging activities of the extracts from 15 plants including T. chebula gall selected from the Thai medicinal plant recipes that have been traditionally used for longevity. Materials and methods: The plant extracts were prepared by four extraction methods including hot (HW) and cold (CW) aqueous processes and hot (HM) and cold (CM) methanol processes. These extracts were tested for antioxidative and tyrosinase inhibition activity as well as the proliferative and MMP-2 inhibition activity on early aging human skin fibroblasts in order to evaluate their in vitro anti-aging activity. Results: At 0.1mg/mL, the CW extract of T. chebula gall exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity with scavenging of 84.64\%±2.22\%, whereas ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol and butylated hydroxyl toluene gave 96.50\%±0.1\%, 35.74\%±0.2\% and 27.43\%±0.1\%, respectively. The CW extract of T. chebula gall indicated the highest stimulation index (SI) on normal human fibroblast proliferation of 1.441 which was more active than ascorbic acid (SI 1.21). This extract has also demonstrated MMP-2 inhibition on fibroblasts determined by zymography 1.37 times more potent than ascorbic acid. Discussion and conclusion: This study has confirmed the traditional use of T. chebula gall in many Thai medicinal plant recipes for longevity which will be beneficial for further development of anti-aging products.},

Aβ increases free radical production in neuronal cells, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. An intervention that would reduce Aβ-related neurotoxicity through free radical reduction could advance the treatment of AD. Notoginsenoside R1 (NR1), the major and most active ingredient in the herb Panax notoginseng, can reduce reactive oxygen species and confer some neuroprotective effects. Here, NR1 was applied in a cell-based model of Alzheimer's disease. Cell viability, cell death, reactive oxygen species generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed in cultured PC12 neuronal cells incubated with Aβ{$<$}inf{$>$}25-35{$<$}/inf{$>$}. In this model, Aβ was neurotoxic and induced necrosis and apoptosis; however, NR1 significantly counteracted the effects of Aβ by increasing cell viability, reducing oxidative damage (including apoptosis), restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppressing stress-activated MAPK signaling pathways. These results promise a great potential agent for Alzheimer's disease and other Aβ pathology-related neuronal degenerative disease. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Under the guidance of LC-QTOF-MS, a new trace saponin was probed according to the precise elemental compositions of molecular ions and the fragmentation behavior, and then separated from the ethanol extract of the plant by a set of chromatographic methods. It was further confirmed by NMR experiments as 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside-3β,l2β,23β-triol-20-ene-dammar (Pn-1). The cytotoxic assay showed that Pn-1 had relatively stronger anti-tumor effects against three tumor cell lines (NCI-H460, HepG2 and SGC-7901) than Rg3, an approved clinical agent for cancer therapy. Meanwhile, based on accurate mass measurements within 5ppm for each molecular ions and subsequent product ions, 48 saponins, including 40 protopanaxadiol saponins, 7 protopanaxatriol saponins and 1 oleanane saponin were identified. It is noted that the knowledge of the presence of abundant protopanaxadiol saponins in leaves of P. notoginseng may provide tools for a full understanding of the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites from the different parts of P. notoginseng. From the points of time consuming and accurate mass measurement capability, the LC-QTOF-MS is a highly powerful tool for screening and guiding target separation of new compounds in herbal extract, and thus benefits the speed of new drug discovery progress. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In addition to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant actions of quercetin, we especially describe a novel mechanism of quercetin's action on the cytosolic Cl-concentration ([Cl-]c) and novel roles of the cytosolic Cl-i.e., (1) quercetin elevates [Cl-]c by activating Na+-K+-2Cl-cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) in renal epithelial cells contributing to Na+ reabsorption via the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC); (2) the quercetin-induced elevation of [Cl-]c in renal epithelial cells diminishes expression of ENaC leading to a decrease in renal Na+ reabsorption; and (3) this reduction of ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption in renal epithelial cells drops volume-dependent elevated blood pressure. In this review, we introduce novel, unique mechanisms of quercetin's anti-hypertensive action via activation of NKCC1 in detail.},

  abstract = {Many Eryngium species have been traditionally used as ornamental, edible or medicinal plants. The gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses have shown that the major compounds in the aerial parts were spathulenol (in E. campestre and E. palmatum oils) and germacrene D (in E. amethystinum oil). The main compounds in the root oil were nonanoic acid, 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde and octanoic acid for E. campestre, E. amethystinum and E. palmatum, respectively. All the oils expressed the highest potential against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus as well as Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Molecular docking analysis was used for determining a potential antibacterial activity mechanism of compounds present in the essential oils. Molecular docking confirmed that the binding affinity of spathulenol to the active site of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was the highest among the tested dominant compounds. Regarding the total phenolic content (determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay) and flavonoid content (evaluated using aluminum nitrate nonahydrate), the highest amount was found in the ethyl acetate extract of E. palmatum. The results of DPPH and ABTS assay indicated that the highest antioxidant activity was present in the water extract of E. amethystinum. Extracts of the aerial parts presented as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) expressed the activity in the range 0.004-20.00~mg/mL, with the highest activity exhibited by the acetone and ethyl acetate extracts against Proteus mirabilis. The obtained results suggest that Eryngium species may be considered a beneficial native source of the compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.},

It can be found in many plant species, among which the mango tree (Mangifera indica) is one of the primary sources. Mangiferin is also present in some medicinal herbs, influencing their therapeutic and preventive properties, and in honeybush (Cyclopia sp.), a popular South African herbal tea. Mangiferin dissolves well in water, so it can be easily extracted into infusions and decoctions. In the mangiferin molecule, four aromatic hydroxyl groups determine its strong antiradical and antioxidant properties. Mangiferin is also an efficient iron chelator, therefore preventing the generation of hydroxyl radical in Fenton-type reactions. Numerous published in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies, demonstrated many other activities of mangiferin: analgesic, antidiabetic, antisclerotic, atimicrobial and antiviral, cardio-, hepato-, and neuroprotective, antiinflammatory, antiallergic, MAO inhibiting and memory improving, as well as radioprotective against X-ray, gamma, and UV radiation. Several studies indicated also its ability to inhibit cancerogenesis and cancer cells growth by apoptosis induction in vitro and in vivo. It is also used in cosmetics, due to antioxidant and UV-protecting properties.},

After 1 month of treatment, the DM + L-NAME group exhibited renal vasoconstriction and lacked hyperfiltration. Acute administration of L-NAME, 2.5 mg/kg, depressed the glomerular filtration rate and promoted renal vasoconstriction to a much greater extent in the DM than in the C group. Acute administration of endothelin 1 (600 ng/kg, bolus) or angiotensin II (25 micrograms/kg/min, continuous infusion) exerted similar hemodynamic effects in the C and DM groups, suggesting that the enhanced response of DM to L-NAME reflected specific sensitivity to NO inhibition. Urinary excretion of nitrites and nitrates was fourfold higher in DM compared to C. These results support the notion that augmented NO production may contribute to renal hyperfiltration and hyperperfusion in diabetes.},

All rights reserved Keywords bioactive food components, lipophilic, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, drugs, excipient foods, medical foods, functional foods, food effects, delivery systems Abstract The oral bioavailability of a health-promoting dietary component (nu- traceutical) may be limited by various physicochemical and physiological phenomena: liberation from food matrices, solubility in gastrointestinal fluids, interaction with gastrointestinal components, chemical degradation or metabolism, and epithelium cell permeability. Nutraceutical bioavail- ability can therefore be improved by designing food matrices that control their bioaccessibility ( B ∗ ), absorption ( A ∗ ), and transformation ( T ∗ ) within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This article reviews the major factors influencing the gastrointestinal fate of nutraceuticals, and then uses this information to develop a new scheme to classify the major factors limiting nutraceutical bioavailability: the nutraceutical bioavailability classification scheme (NuBACS). This new scheme is analogous to the biopharmaceutical classification scheme (BCS) used by the pharmaceutical industry to classify drug bioavailability, but it contains additional factors important for under- standing nutraceutical bioavailability in foods. The article also highlights potential strategies for increasing the oral bioavailability of nutraceuticals based on their NuBACS designation ( B ∗ A ∗ T ∗ )},

  abstract = {Although Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is primarily a neurocognitive disorder, it also results in prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Much literature has investigated the NPS of apathy and depression in association with AD, but relatively less is known regarding anxiety, the third most common NPS in this disorder. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms in AD is about 40\%, and it can be a prelude of AD. Anxiety can be especially present among patients with mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, or early-onset forms of the disease, and can promote progression or conversion to Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome. A number of studies have established that anxiety is associated with positive amyloid scans, mesial temporal changes with atrophy and hypometabolism in the entorhinal region, and neurofibrillary tangles present on pathological examination of this region. In addition to psychosocial factors, proposed neurobiological mechanisms for increased anxiety in AD include decreased sensorimotor gating, relatively increased activation of amygdalae or the Salience Network, and the presence of comorbid pathology, particularly Lewy bodies. Having management strategies for anxiety in patients with AD is important as anxiety can worsen cognitive deficits. Interventions involve psychological support, behavioral management, and the judicious use of the psychiatric armamentarium of medications.},

Here, we studied the in-vivo and in-vitro effects of gene-silencing therapy specific for the Cav3.2 isoform of T-channels, on thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity, and T-current expression in small and medium-size DRG neurons of STZ-treated rats. We found that silencing of the T-channel Cav3.2 isoform using antisense oligonucleotides, had a profound and selective anti-hyperalgesic effect in diabetic rats and is accompanied by significant down-regulation of T-currents in DRG neurons. Anti-hyperalgesic effects of CaV3.2 antisense oligonucleotides in diabetic rats were similar in models of rapid and slow onset of hyperglycemia following intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of STZ, respectively. Furthermore, treatments of diabetic rats with daily insulin injections reversed T-current alterations in DRG neurons in parallel with reversal of thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity in-vivo. This confirms that CaV3.2 T-channels, important signal amplifiers in peripheral sensory neurons, may contribute to the cellular hyperexcitability that ultimately leads to the development of painful PDN.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The most common problems of modern medicine include fungal infections of the skin and its appendages caused by dermatomycetes, yeast-like fungi and moulds. Due to toxicity of pharmacological fungicides and promotion of ecology, natural substances with high antifungal properties are sought. Essential oils and their components show potential in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fourteen commercial essential oils were tested for antifungal activity. The study were carried out by agar dilution method against the following fungal species: Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton violaceum, Aspergillus niger, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and (IZ 1) dog skin isolate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values were determined for all tested oils and individual components of oils with the highest activity against the tested fungi. GC-MS analysis was performed for the most active oils. RESULTS: Cinnamon, thyme, clove, geranium and manuka oils were most active against the test fungi. The MIC values in the tested oils were in the range of 0.5-{$>$}10μg/μl and the MFC amounted to 1.25-{$>$}10μg/μl. Activity of individual components against the tested fungi strains was selective and clearly higher against dermatomycetes fungi and IZ 1 isolate. The strongest effect on dermatomycetes fungi was of cinnamaldehyde, thymol and carvacrol-with the values of 0.039-1.25μg/μl (MIC) and 0.078-1.25μg/μl (MFC). In turn, the highest activity against IZ 1 isolate was of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, carvacrol, geraniol and thymol. Their MIC and MFC was 0.313-1.25μg/μl. CONCLUSION: The results prove the applicability of selected oils and their components as alternatives to synthetic agents in combating fungal dermatoses in animals and humans.},

BR, C3G and its metabolites suppressed the production of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, and the inflammatory mediators, NO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as well as the gene expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in RAW 264.7 cells. These agents also inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α, the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, these agents significantly inhibited the leukocyte number and the levels of TNF-α, PGE2, and protein in the exudates of the air pouch in carrageenan-treated mice, as well as COX-2 expression and NF-κB activation. Among the test agents, PA most potently inhibited these inflammatory mediators in vivo and in vitro. Based on these findings, if BR is orally administered, its main constituent, C3G, may be metabolized to cyanidin and/or PA, which express potent anti-inflammatory effects by regulating NF-κB and MAPK activation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the successive isolation and purification of bioactive compounds from the stem bark of Jatropha podagrica, a widely known medicinal plant. The ethyl acetate extract of the stem bark exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays (IC50 = 46.7, 66.0, and 492.6, respectively). By column chromatography (CC) with elution of hexane and ethyl acetate at 8:2, 7:3, and 6:4 ratios, the isolation of this active extract yielded five fractions (C1–C5). Chemical structures of the constituents included in C1–C5 were elucidated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and resolved as methyl gallate (C1, C2, C3, C4), gallic acid (C1, C2), fraxetin (C2, C3, C4, C5), and tomentin (C3). Mixture C2 (IC50 DPPH and ABTS = 2.5 µg/mL) and C3 (IC50 FRAP = 381 µg/mL) showed the highest antioxidant properties. Among the isolated fractions, C4 was the most potential agent in growth inhibition of six bacterial strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, and Proteus mirabilis (MIC = 5, 20, 30, 20, 25, and 20 mg/mL, respectively). All identified constituents exerted an inhibitory activity on the growth of Lactuca sativa, of which the mixture C3 performed the maximal inhibition on shoot (IC50 = 49.4 µg/mL) and root (IC50 = 47.1 µg/mL) growth. Findings of this study suggest that gallic acid, methyl gallate, fraxetin, and tomentin isolated from J. podagrica possessed antioxidant, antibacterial, and growth inhibitory potentials.},

Phytosterols inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, thereby lowering plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. In 16 recently published human studies that used phytosterols to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in a total of 590 subjects, phytosterol therapy was accompanied by an average 10\% reduction in total cholesterol and 13\% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. Phytosterols may also affect other aspects of cholesterol metabolism that contribute to their antiatherogenic properties, and may interfere with steroid hormone synthesis. The clinical and biochemical features of hereditary sitosterolemia, as well as its treatment, are reviewed, and the effects of cholestyramine treatment in 12 sitosterolemic subjects are summarized. Finally, new ideas for future research into the role of phytosterols in health and disease are discussed.},

It is used in traditional medicine, especially for wound healing, jaundice, blood purification, and as an antispasmodic. Chemical studies have underlined the presence of various classes of compounds, the main being triterpenoids, flavonoids, coumarines, quinones, volatile oil, carotenoids and amino acids. The extract of this plant as well as pure compounds isolated from it, have been demonstrated to possess multiple pharmacological activities such as anti-HIV, cytotoxic, antiinflammatory, hepatoprotective, spasmolytic and spasmogenic, amongst others. In this review, we have explored the phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of C. officinalis in order to collate existing information on this plant as well as highlight its multi-activity properties as a medicinal agent. This is as a result of the worldwide cultivation of the plant and increasing published reports on it.},

Forty-four Pekin ducklings were inoculated intraperitoneally with DHBV at 24 hr post-hatch. They were treated by intraperitoneal injection of Phyllanthus amarus (aqueous extract) (100 mg/kg body weight) or Phyllanthus mad eraspatensis (alcoholic extract) (100 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 4 weeks. Infected ducklings treated with saline served as controls. Weekly serum samples obtained before, during, and after treatment were analysed for the presence of DHBV DNA in serum by dot blot hybridisation using alpha 32P-labelled probes. Liver tissue was collected after killing the ducks at various time intervals and was studied for replicative status of the viral DNA and liver histopathology; 17 of 21 ducks were viraemic on completion of treatment with Phyllanthus amarus. At 16 week posttreatment follow-up four of seven animals remained viraemic. Similar results were obtained with Phyllanthus maderaspatensis. There was no alteration in DHBV replication in the liver. No toxicity was observed with this treatment. These observations suggest that Phyllanthus amarus and Phyllanthus maderaspatensis are not useful as therapeutic agents for postexposure prophylaxis against DHBV infection.}

The method recorded limits of detection for 1, 2, 3 and 4 as 1.22, 6.02, 0.61 and 1.22ng/ml, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5:1 whereas their limits of quantification were 4.88, 24.41, 4.88 and 9.76ng/ml, respectively, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 12:1. These values were comparable to those of other sensitive methods such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), high-performance liquid chromatography–MS (HPLC–MS) and HPLC–electrochemical detection (HPLC–ECD) for the analysis of plasma lignans. A further advantage over known methods was its simple protocol for sample preparation. The within-day and between-day accuracies for the analysis of the four lignans were between 87.69 and 110.07\% with precision values below 10.51\%. Their mean recoveries from extraction were between 91.39 and 114.67\%. The method was successfully applied in the pharmacokinetic study of lignans in rats. Following intravenous administration, the lignans were eliminated slowly from the body with a mean clearance of 0.04, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.02l/kgh and a mean half-life of 3.56, 3.87, 3.35 and 4.40h for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Their peak plasma concentration upon oral administration was 0.18, 0.56, 0.12 and 0.62μg/ml, respectively, after 1h. However, their absorption was incomplete with a calculated absolute oral bioavailability of 0.62, 1.52, 4.01 and 2.66\% for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.}

On spray drying of these food materials, the powder particles stick to one another and to the walls of the dryer, leading to the operational problems and low product yield. The sticky behavior is attributed to presence of low molecular weight sugars and organic acids which have low glass transition temperature. In order to achieve successful drying, various methods like addition of high molecular weight drying aids to increase glass transition temperature of feed mixture, use of low humidity and low temperature conditions, scrapping of dryer surfaces, cooling of dryer wall by using dehumidified air and surface modification by proteins to encapsulate sugars can be used.},

  abstract = {The use of bioactive compounds in different commercial sectors such as pharmaceutical, food and chemical industries signifies the need of the most appropriate and standard method to extract these active components from plant materials. In the present study, conventional method (maceration) and some new methods (ultrasound-assisted extraction, hot plate extraction and microwave-assisted extraction) using different solvents have been developed for the extraction of bioactive compounds from citrus peels. This study is aimed to discuss different extraction techniques along with their basic mechanism for extracting bioactive compounds from citrus waste (peels). The antioxidant capacity of citrus waste (peels) was studied using 2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay. Three solvent systems were used (ethanol, water and aqueous ethanol) at different concentrations. The suitability of citrus peels, generated as a by-product of the juice industry, as a source of antioxidants was investigated. Our results revealed that the extraction method, solvent and time had a significant effect on the amount of the extracted compounds. In terms of extraction method applied, ultrasound-assisted extraction was the more effective technique compared to the other methods. The extraction time was reduced, less solvent was used and the amount of extracted compounds was increased.}

Microparticles were intended for oral use in order to provide a controlled release, and improved in vitro and in vivo biological effects. FA-loaded Eudragit® L100 microparticles were obtained by spray-drying. Physicochemical properties, in vitro cell-based effects, and in vivo platelet aggregation were investigated. FA-loaded Eudragit® L100 microparticles were successfully prepared by spray-drying. Formulations showed suitable encapsulation efficiency, i.e. close to 100\%. Microparticles were of spherical and almost-spherical shape with a smooth surface and a mean diameter between 2 and 3 μm. Fourier-transformed infrared spectra demonstrated no chemical bond between FA and polymer. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analyses indicated that microencapsulation led to drug amorphization. FA-loaded microparticles showed a slower dissolution rate than pure drug. The chosen formulation demonstrated higher in vitro cytoprotection, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory potential and also improved in vivo anti-platelet effect. These results support an experimental basis for the use of FA spray-dried microparticles as a feasible oral drug delivery carrier for the controlled release of FA and improved cytoprotective and anti-platelet effects.},

Intragastric treatment with an aqueous extract (250 mg/kg) and its lipophilic fractions (4 mg/kg) significantly improved delayed gastric emptying. The major constituents of the lipophilic fraction were two sesquiterpens, hinesol and ??-eudesmol, and four known polyacetylenic compounds, atractylodin, atractylodinol, acetylatractylodinol and 4,6,12-tetradecatriene-8,10-diyne-1,3,14-triol. The activity was found in the four polyacetylenic compounds at a similar potency, but not in the two sesquiterpens. To clarify the effect of the four polyacetylenic compounds in this extract, we attempted to evaluate the activity of atractylodin, as representative, at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg based on the total amounts (0.2 mg/250 mg aqueous extract) of the four polyacetylenic compounds. In addition, atractylodin improved the delay in gastric emptying at between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the aqueous extract improved the delayed gastric emptying, and polyacetylenic compounds contributed to its activity. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

All arabinose residues, which constitute 21\% of total SSPS sugars, were found to be in side chains from RG regions, and this was also true for galactose residues, which constitute 50\% of total sugars. Of arabinose residues, 94\% are present as α-1,3-or α-1,5-arabinans, and 89\% of galactose residues were present as β-1,4-galactans.

While the addition of SSPS to emulsions stabilized by caseinate did not affect the droplet size distribution, SSPS caused bridging of emulsion droplets stabilized by WPI. The interactions between WPI and SSPS seemed to be electrostatic in nature and were affected by the type of SSPS used. Although destabilization was also shown at pH 7.0, extensive bridging flocculation was shown at pH 4.0.

  abstract = {Soybean soluble polysaccharide (SSPS) is obtained from the by-product of the production of soy protein. SSPS has been employed as a functional ingredient in numerous food applications. When used to prepare oil-in-water emulsions, SSPS forms thick, stable interfaces in a wide pH range, in both acidic and neutral conditions. SSPS forms stable interfacial layers at relatively low biopolymer concentrations (about 4\% (w/w) in 20\% (w/w) oil-in-water emulsions), and although rich in galacturonic acid, its functionality does not seem to be affected by varying concentration of cations. This work describes the emulsifying properties of SSPS and its stability under various environmental conditions and the principles that regulate the stabilization behavior of this polysaccharide. SSPS contains a high molecular weight polysaccharide fraction with interfacial properties and a small molecular weight fraction. A polypeptide fraction, with an estimated molecular mass of 50 kDa, is covalently linked to the SSPS backbone chains and acts as an anchor to the oil-water interface. The carbohydrate moieties of the SSPS stabilize the emulsion droplets via steric interactions, forming a thick (ranging between 15 and 30 nm, depending on the SSPS type), hydrated layer on the surface of the oil droplet. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

SSPS/HMF consisted of 91.6\% carbohydrate and 2.2\% protein and showed better emulsifying properties than those of the whole SSPS, whereas SSPS/LMF seemed to affect negatively the adsorption behavior of SSPS. SDS-PAGE of the protein fraction obtained from SSPS/HMF showed a molecular mass of 50 kDa, was composed predominantly of proline (23.1\%) and glutamic acid (15.2\%), and still contained 8.8\% of neutral sugar and 5.3\% of uronic acid. Results indicated that not all of the protein material present in SSPS contributes to SSPS functionality but that only the material associated with HMF aids in the adsorption of SSPS onto oil/water interfaces.},

This study was a randomized clinical trial conducted with 126 eligible primiparous patients. The pain severity of patients was measured at the time of enrolling in the study. In the intervention group, (aromatherapy) gauze squares were soaked in 4 ml of C. aurantium distillated water, and in the control group, gauze squares were soaked in 4 ml of normal saline; each gauze square was attached to the respective patients' collar. The intervention was repeated every 30 min. Pain severity was measured after the intervention at 3-4, 5-7, and 8-10 cm cervix dilatations. The two groups were standardized with regard to age, profession, education, desire to conceive, and number and severity of uterine contractions. The Bishop's score was also calculated. Before intervention, pain severity was the same for both groups, but following intervention, pain severity reduced in the intervention group at 3-4 centimeter (P {$<$} 0.05), 7-5 centimeter (P {$<$} 0.05), and 8-10 centimeter (P {$<$} 0.05) dilatations compared with that in the control group. The findings of the study revealed that aromatherapy using C. aurantium distillated water alleviates labor pain. This method is recommended because of its ease of use and low cost and because it is a non-aggressive method to reduce labor pain.},

OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the chronic effects of an extract of B. monniera (Keenmind) on cognitive function in healthy human subjects. METHODS: The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled independent-group design in which subjects were randomly allocated to one of two treatment conditions, B. monniera (300 mg) or placebo. Neuropsychological testing was conducted pre-(baseline) and at 5 and 12 weeks post drug administration. RESULTS: B. monniera significantly improved speed of visual information processing measured by the IT task, learning rate and memory consolidation measured by the AVLT (P{$<$}0.05), and state anxiety (P{$<$}0.001) compared to placebo, with maximal effects evident after 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that B. monniera may improve higher order cognitive processes that are critically dependent on the input of information from our environment such as learning and memory.},

Further, the azurophilic secretory response remained localized in the presence of cytochalasin B. Release of azurophilic-granule content was inhibited by genistein and erbstatin, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, and by GF109203X, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor.

In 2003, the European Commission approved Tahitian noni juice as a novel food by the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General. Among noni’s several health benefits, others and we have demonstrated the anti-diabetic effects of fermented noni fruit juice in animal models. Unfortunately, noni’s exciting journey from Polynesian medicine to the research bench does not reach its final destination of successful clinical outcomes when translated into commercial products. Noni products are perceived to be safe due to their “natural” origin. However, inadequate evidence regarding bioactive compounds, molecular targets, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, effective dosages, and/or unanticipated side effects are major roadblocks to successful translation “from bench side to bedside”.

  abstract = {Hepatitis-C is a global public health problem in India, and responsible for major chunk of morbidity and mortality. The present study focuses on effect of phyllanthus amarus therapy for protection of liver in hepatitis-C through investigating liver profile enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, antioxidant vitamins and lipid peroxidation. The study consists of 50 clinical diag-nosed hepatitis-C patients ranging in between age group 25-60 years. The control group in-cludes 50 ages and sex matched normal healthy persons. Oxidative stress was assessed by es-timating lipid peroxidation [LPO]. The parameters like serum bilirubin, total proteins and activity of liver profile enzymes were done. Activity of enzymatic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxides [GPx], catalase and levels of non-enzymatic anti-oxidant vitamin E and vitamin C was measured in plasma or erythrocytes. Methods used in the study are mainly enzyme kinetics by autoanalyzer and by turbidimetry. Plasma LPO levels were significantly high but activity of SOD, GPx, catalase and levels of vitamin E and vitamin C were significantly lowered in hepatitis- C on comparison with controls. After phyllanthus amarus therapy for 5 weeks and 10 weeks plasma LPO levels were significantly decreased and activity of SOD, GPx, catalase and vitamin E and vitamin C were signifi-cantly increased in hepatitis-C. The present study concludes that, hepatitis-C increases oxi-dative stress and may be playing an important role in hepatic cell damage and pathogenesis of hepatitis-C. This study strongly suggests that the therapy with phyllanthus amarus in-creases antioxidants and reduces lipid peroxidation of hepatic cellular and intracellular membranes and protects liver damage due to free radicals in hepatitis-C.},

  abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Acute spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCII) is associated with pathological changes, including inflammation, edema, and neuronal apoptosis. Panax notoginsenoside (PNS), an important traditional Chinese medicine, has shown a variety of beneficial effects, including homeostasis maintenance, anti-myocardial ischemia activities, and neuroprotective functions. However, whether it can produce neuroprotective effects in SCII and the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Aim of the study: In the present study, we investigated the effects of PNS on neurological and histopathological changes after SCII as well as the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Sixty-four adult rats were randomly assigned into one of the four groups: the sham group, the ischemic group, the PNS group, and the Methylprednisolone group. A rat model of SCII was adopted from a commonly used protocol that was initially proposed by Zivin. Neurological function was evaluated with the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale. Histopathological changes were examined with hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as Nissl staining. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were conducted to compare the changes in tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-10, aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), member 6 of the TNF receptor superfamily (Fas), and Fas ligand (FasL) in the spinal cord. Finally, neuronal apoptosis was measured by electron microscopy. Results: The BBB scores of the PNS-treated injured animals were significantly increased. The gross histopathological examination showed restored neuronal morphology and increased number of neurons after the PNS treatment. The PNS treatment decreased SCII-induced up-regulation of cytokine levels. In addition, PNS suppressed the increased expression of AQP-4 after SCII, suggesting an anti-edema effect. Finally, PNS treatment inhibited injury-induced apoptosis and reduced the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, Fas and FasL, confirming its anti-apoptosis effects against SCII. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that PNS produces robust neuroprotective effects in spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury, and this role may be mediated by its anti-inflammation, anti-edema, and anti-apoptosis actions. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Diabetic hyperglycaemia causes a variety of pathological changes in small vessels, arteries and peripheral nerves. Vascular endothelial cells are an important target of hyperglycaemic damage, but the mechanisms underlying this damage are not fully understood. Three seemingly independent biochemical pathways are involved in the pathogenesis: glucose-induced activation of protein kinase C isoforms; increased formation of glucose-derived advanced glycation end-products; and increased glucose flux through the aldose reductase pathway. The relevance of each of these pathways is supported by animal studies in which pathway-specific inhibitors prevent various hyperglycaemia-induced abnormalities. Hyperglycaemia increases the production of reactive oxygen species inside cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Here we show that this increase in reactive oxygen species is prevented by an inhibitor of electron transport chain complex II, by an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, by uncoupling protein-1 and by manganese superoxide dismutase. Normalizing levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species with each of these agents prevents glucose-induced activation of protein kinase C, formation of advanced glycation end-products, sorbitol accumulation and NFkappaB activation.}

The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. KEGG maintains the GENES database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the LIGAND database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, KEGG develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).}

In isolated rat aortic rings, scopoletin (26-520 microM) inhibited to approximately the same extent the contractions induced by a variety of substances, including phenylephrine, potassium chloride, serotonin and PGF(2) (alpha). The effect of the coumarin on phenylephrine-induced contractions was not affected by endothelium removal or NO-synthase blockade by L-NAME (100 microM). Scopoletin (78 - 590 microM) antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 300 +/- 20 microM, n = 5), transient contractions in Ca(2+)-free media induced by noradrenaline, but not those induced by caffeine. Also, scopoletin did not interfere with the refilling of noradrenaline-sensitive intracellular calcium stores. It is suggested that the non-specific spasmolytic action of scopoletin can be attributed, at least in part, to its ability to inhibit the intracellular calcium mobilization from the noradrenaline-sensitive stores.},

(family Nymphaeaceae) has been used for summer heat syndrome as home remedy in Japan and China, and it has recently been used to treat obesity in China. So we investigate the pharmacological mechanism of the anti-obesity effect of Nelumbo nucifera leaves extract (NNE). We examined the effect of NNE on digestive enzyme activity, lipid metabolism and theromogenesis and evaluated the effects of anti-obesity using high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice that were treated with NNE for 5 weeks. NNE caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the activities of α-amylase and lipase, and up-regulated lipid metabolism and expression of UCP3 mRNA in C2C12 myotubes. NNE prevented the increase in body weight, parametrial adipose tissue weight and liver triacylglycerol levels in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. UCP3 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle tended to be higher, when mice were administrated by NNE and were exercised. Therefore, NNE impaired digestion, inhibited absorption of lipids and carbohydrates, accelerated lipid metabolism and up-regulated energy expenditure. Consequently, NNE is beneficial for the suppression of obesity. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Phyllanthus amarus plant suppresses HBV mRNA transcription in vitro and exhibits therapeutic potential in chronic HBV carriers, although further work is necessary to define its mechanism of action. Analysis in HuH-7 cells with transfected plasmids using a luciferase reporter showed that P. amarus specifically inhibited HBV enhancer I activity. To identify the mechanism of this HBV enhancer I inhibition, liver-enriched cellular transcription factors were co-expressed in HuH-7 cells. The C/EBP alpha and beta, as well as HNF-3 alpha and beta transcription factors, significantly up-regulated the HBV enhancer I activity. In contrast, co-transfection of HNF-I alpha or beta had no effect upon the HBV enhancer I activity. Exposure to P. amarus inhibited C/EBP alpha- and beta-mediated up-regulation of HBV enhancer I activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HNF-3 alpha- and beta-mediated up-regulation of HBV enhancer I was unaffected. In vitro gel shifts showed that P. amarus inhibited complexing of C/EBP transcription factors to a consensus oligonucleotide sequence, whereas DNA binding of AP-1 and SP-1 transcription factors was unaffected. As P. amarus down-regulates HBV mRNA transcription by a specific mechanism involving interactions between HBV enhancer I and C/EBP transcription factors, purification and further analysis of the active P. amarus component will advance insights into its antiviral activity.}

The antioxidant activities were investigated in two bioassays. Firstly, we demonstrated inhibition of Heinz bodies induction caused by oxidants under in vitro condition. The percentages of Heinz body inhibition activity in plant extracts from Terminalia citrina, Cassia timoriensis, and Derris elliptica were the highest followed by Anamirta cocculus, and Oroxylum indicum respectively. In addition, we investigated total antioxidant activity in plant extracts by improved ABTS radical cation decolorization assay. The total antioxidant activity of the extract from Terminalia citrina was also the highest activity followed by Ficus pubigera, Derris elliptica, Anamirta cocculus, Caesalpinia sappan, and Oroxylum indicum respectively. Our results suggest medicinal Thai plants as valuable sources of antioxidants, which may have a potential anti-carcinogenic activity.},

This investigation is to elicit the mechanism of these components in hypertension via their effect on vascular reaction. To assess the ability of P.N. in hypertension, P.N. extracts were injected in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) via the vena caudalis; Low dosages of P.N. extracts significantly lowered blood pressure in SHR. Examination with Rb1 and Rg1 revealed significant vasodilatation using mouse coronary arteries in a dose-dependent manner. Rb1- and Rg1-induced vasodilatation was blocked by pre-incubation with eNOS and PI3K inhibitors. Coronaries of eNOS-/- mice showed attenuated vasodilatation with Rb1 and Rg1. In addition, both Rb1 and Rg1 induce nitric oxide (NO) generation through increasing the phosphorylation of eNOS, activating Na + - independent l-arginine transport, and stimulating cationic amino acid transport (CAT)-1 mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells. Conclusion: Ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1 increased endothelial-dependent vessel dilatation through the activation of NO by modulating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway and l-arginine transport in endothelial cells. These findings may have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of clinical efficacy of the herb P.N. when used in the regulation of blood pressure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Albendazole, a hydrophobic drug used for the treatment of hydatid cysts, was encapsulated in nanosize liposomes. Rapid evaporation method was used for the preparation of albendazole-encapsulated conventional and PEGylated liposomes consisting of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol (CH) in the molar ratios of (6:4) and PC:CH: polyethylene glycol (PEG) (5:4:1), respectively. In this study, PEGylated and conventional liposomes containing albendazole were prepared and their characteristics, such as particle size, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro drug release were investigated. The drug encapsulation efficiency of PEGylated and conventional liposomes was 81\% and 72\%, respectively. The biophysical characterization of both conventional and PEG-coated liposomes were done by transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis spectrophotometry. Efforts were made to study in vitro release of albendazole. The drug release rate showed decrease in albendazole release in descending order: free albendazole, albendazole-loaded conventional liposomes, and least with albendazole-loaded PEG-liposomes. Biologically relevant vesicles were prepared and in vitro release of liposome-entrapped albendazole was determined.},

  abstract = {Innovations in information and communication technology infuse all branches of science, including life sciences. Nevertheless, healthcare is historically slow in adopting technological innovation, compared with other industrial sectors. In recent years, new approaches in modelling and simulation have started to provide important insights in biomedicine, opening the way for their potential use in the reduction, refinement and partial substitution of both animal and human experimentation. In light of this evidence, the European Parliament and the United States Congress made similar recommendations to their respective regulators to allow wider use of modelling and simulation within the regulatory process. In the context of in silico medicine, the term ‘in silico clinical trials’ refers to the development of patient-specific models to form virtual cohorts for testing the safety and/or efficacy of new drugs and of new medical devices. Moreover, it could be envisaged that a virtual set of patients could complement a clinical trial (reducing the number of enrolled patients and improving statistical significance), and/or advise clinical decisions. This article will review the current state of in silico clinical trials and outline directions for a full-scale adoption of patient-specific modelling and simulation in the regulatory evaluation of biomedical products. In particular, we will focus on the development of vaccine therapies, which represents, in our opinion, an ideal target for this innovative approach.},

  abstract = {We assessed the prevention of hepatic fibrogenesis by water-extract of Panax notoginseng Buck F.H. Chen. (Arialiaceae) root (PNS) in Long-Evans rats with cinnamon coat color (LEC rats). LEC rats were divided into three groups A, fed on a basal diet (BD); B, fed on BD plus 1\% PNS; and C), fed on BD plus 0.005\% lycopene as a control. All rats were sacrificed at 26 weeks of age. The percentage of the total area involved by fibrosis was 1.46 ± 0.47 in group A, 0.83 ± 0.10 in B (P = 0.0030, B vs A) and 0.91 ± 0.45 in C (P = 0.0035, C vs. A). The percentage of the total area that was stained for α-SMA was 0.56 ± 0.34 in group A, 0.15 ± 0.02 in B (P = 0.0016, B vs. A and 0.11 ± 0.01 in C (P = 0.0025, C vs. A. In group B, malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver was lower than in group C (P = 0.007). In group C, the concentration of iron in the liver was lower than in group A (P = 0.0053). Thus, PNS suppressed fibrogenesis through reduced generation of lipid peroxides. The mechanisms of this preventive effect of fibrogenesis with PNS were suggested to inhibit the stellate cell activity. Second objective of this study was to determine whether PNS affects hepatic microvascular dysfunction elicited by gut ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), since gut I/R causes hepatic microvascular dysfunction, and to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO). Male Wistar rats were exposed to 30 min of gut ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Intravital microscopy was used to monitor the number of non-perfused sinusoids (NPS). In another set of experiments, PNS (1 g/kg per day intragastrically) was administered to rats for 7 days. In some experiments, dexamethasone (ST) (2 mg/kg per day intravenously) was administered. In control rats, gut I/R elicited increases in the number of NPS, and plasma TNF-α and ALT activities, and these changes were mitigated by the pretreatment with PNS. Pretreatment with an NO synthase inhibitor diminished the protective effects of PNS on the increase in NPS and plasma TNF-α levels, but not its effect on the increase in plasma ALT activities. Pretreatment with PNS increased plasma nitrite/nitrate levels. The responses caused by gut I/R were attenuated by the pretreatment with ST. Pretreatment with an NO synthase inhibitor did not affect the effect of ST. These results suggest that PNS attenuates the gut I/R-induced hepatic microvascular dysfunction and inflammatory responses such as TNF-α production in the early phase via enhancement of NO production, and sequential hepatocellular damage via its anti-inflammatory effect. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The gamma terpinene (γ-TPN) is a monoterpene present in plant species that have multiple pharmacological properties and has structural similarity to antinociceptive monoterpenes, such as limonene and alpha-phellandrene. The γ-TPN molecular mass was evaluated by mass spectrometry and showed a pseudomolecular ion with 137.0\,Da. The animals did not present any signs of acute toxicity at 2\,g/kg, p.o. γ-TPN (1.562 to 50\,mg/kg, p.o.) showed an antinociceptive effect in the formalin, capsaicin, and glutamate tests. γ-TPN has antinociceptive action when administered by others routes in glutamate test. To eliminate a possible sedative effect of γ-TPN, the open field and rota-rod test were conducted and the γ-TPN did not show muscle relaxant activity or central depressant effect. To investigate the mechanisms of action, the animals were pretreated with naloxone, glibenclamide, atropine, mecamylamine, or L-arginine in the glutamate test. γ-TPN antinociception was inhibited in the presence of naloxone, glibenclamide, atropine, and mecamylamine. The results suggest that the γ-TPN (p.o.) produced antinociceptive effect in models of chemical nociception through the cholinergic and opioid systems involvement.},

We will concentrate on the evidence that a local and/or systemic redox dysregulation accompanies the chronic inflammatory disorder events associated to psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We will also discuss the fact that several well-established treatments for the therapy of chronic inflammatory skin disorders are based on the application of strong physical or chemical oxidants onto the skin, indicating that, in selected conditions, a further increase of the oxidative imbalance may lead to a beneficial outcome. © 2010 Saveria Pastore and Liudmila Korkina.},

The bulk density, tapped density, and angle of repose data reveal that S. tora gum possesses good flow property. The intrinsic viscosity obtained was 1.568 dL/g. The average molecular weight of purified S. tora gum was found to be 198 kDa by intrinsic viscosity method. The results indicated that viscosity of gum solution increases with increase in temperature. FTIR study revealed the absence of degradation or decomposition of polysaccharide at accelerated stability conditions for six months. It has been concluded that extracted polysaccharide can be used as pharmaceutical excipient in terms of flow behavior, microbial properties, and stability.}

  abstract = {The capacity of protein to stabilize emulsions is related to the interfacial area that can be coated by the protein. According to the Mie theory for light scattering, a simple relationship exists between turbidity and the interfacial area of an emulsion. In this study, turbidimetry was evaluated as a method for measuring emulsifying properties of proteins. Emulsions were made by homogenizing known amounts of proteins and peanut oil. These emulsions were serially diluted to give absorbances of 0.014.6 at 500 nm. Several factors, i.e., degree of homogenization, type of homogenizer, protein concentration, volume of dispersion, oil volume fraction; pH and type of oil affected emulsion formation. The relative emulsifying activity of various food proteins (casein, P-lactoglobulin, whey protein, yeast protein, ovalbumin, and succinylated yeast proteins) was determined. Using a simple formula based on the turbidity, volume fraction of dispersed phase and weight of protein, an emulsifying activity index, related to the interfacial area of the emulsion, was calculated. Succinylated yeast proteins showed high emulsifying activities. This appeared to be related to the solubility of proteins and their resistance to surface denaturation.},

Chen (Araliaceae), which is a famous traditional Chinese medicine that is used both in raw and treated forms for a long time, led to the isolation of a new dammarane-type saponin, namely notoginsenoside ST-4. Its structure was elucidated to be 3β,12β,20(S)-tri-hydroxydammar-24-ene-3-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-(1~→~2)-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1~→~2)-β-d-glu-copyranoside, based on the detailed analyses of the 1D and 2D NMR spectral data and acidic hydrolysis. Notoginsenoside ST-4 was investigated for its antiviral activity on herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in vitro. The 50\% effective concentration (EC(50)) values, determined by plaque reduction assay, were 16.47~±~0.67 and 19.44~±~1.16~μM for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, whereas the 50\% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) determined by the XTT test on Vero cells was 510.64~±~4.56~μM. As analyzed by attachment assay and penetration assay based on plaque reduction assay, the antiviral activity of notoginsenoside ST-4 was principally due to the penetration inhibition effects, which was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy observation that notoginsenoside ST-4 blocked the penetration of virus. Therefore, notoginsenoside ST-4 might be a promising agent for herpes simplex virus infection.},

Liver index, serum alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured, respectively. Liver index and the degree of liver fibrosis were also determined. Our results showed that the levels of ALT, AST and liver index in PNS-treated group were markedly lower than those in model group. PNS therapy also significantly attenuated the degree of hepatic fibrosis, collagen area and collagen area percent in liver tissue. Furthermore, the levels of serum TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-6 were strikingly reduced in PNS-treated group compared with model group while the production of IL-10 was up-regulated. These findings demonstrate that PNS has certain therapeutic effects on hepatic fibrosis probably by immunoregulating the imbalance between pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic cytokines. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Atherosclerosis constitutes the main pattern of cardiovascular disease and leads to thickening of the intima with plaque formation and eventual occlusion of the arterial lumen. A large amount of evidence links advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with the development or progression of atherosclerosis, regardless of the diabetic status. AGEs are a heterogenous group of compounds formed by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Although AGEs are formed endogenously in the body, diet has recently been recognized as an important exogenous source. An increased understanding of the mechanisms of formation and interaction of AGEs has allowed the development of several potential anti-AGE approaches. Copyright © 2004 by Current Science Inc.}

The granules were developed by wet granulation and contained 2.5\%, 5.0\%, and 10.0\% Eudragit E in the final product concentration. The tablets were produced on a single-punch tablet press by direct compression of granules using 0.5\% magnesium stearate as a lubricant. The tablets were elaborated following a 2 x 3 factorial design, where Eudragit E concentration and compression force were the independent variables, and tensile strength and the extract release of the tablets were the dependent variables. All granules showed better technological properties than the spray-dried extract, including less moisture sorption. The characteristics of the granules were directly dependent on the proportion of Eudragit E in the formulation. In general, all tablets showed high mechanical resistance with less than 1\% friability, less moisture sorption, and a slower extract release profile. The Eudragit E concentration and compression force of the tablets significantly influenced both dependent variables studied. In conclusion, Eudragit E was efficient as a granulating agent for the spray-dried extract, but additional studies are needed to further optimize the formulations in order to achieve less water sorption and improve the release of the extract from the tablets.},

Chronic infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are well-recognized risk factors for cirrhosis and liver cancer, but estimates of their contributions to worldwide disease burden have been lacking. Methods: The prevalence of serologic markers of HBV and HCV infections among patients diagnosed with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was obtained from representative samples of published reports. Attributable fractions of cirrhosis and HCC due to these infections were estimated for 11 WHO-based regions. Results: Globally, 57\% of cirrhosis was attributable to either HBV (30\%) or HCV (27\%) and 78\% of HCC was attributable to HBV (53\%) or HCV (25\%). Regionally, these infections usually accounted for {$>$}50\% of HCC and cirrhosis. Applied to 2002 worldwide mortality estimates, these fractions represent 929,000 deaths due to chronic HBV and HCV infections, including 446,000 cirrhosis deaths (HBV: n = 235,000; HCV: n = 211,000) and 483,000 liver cancer deaths (HBV: n = 328,000; HCV: n = 155,000). Conclusions: HBV and HCV infections account for the majority of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer throughout most of the world, highlighting the need for programs to prevent new infections and provide medical management and treatment for those already infected. ?? 2006 European Association for the Study of the Liver.},

This revealed that 1 was as effective as diclofenac in reducing the intensity of the edema development. The in silico research showed that the activity of 1 might be derived from inhibiting COX-2 by generating h-bonds at the positions of Arg 120, Tyr 355, and Arg 513 residues. The antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) were comparable, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 1.52 to 3.37\,mM. This is the first study of the bioactivity of compounds isolated from D. benenica Q.B.Nguyen \& Škorničk. Our results suggest that 1 may be a nature-derived compound which demonstrates the anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit the proliferation of several Gram-positive bacteria.},

They function as thickening and gelling agents, texturizers, stabilisers and emulsifiers and in addition have application in areas such as edible coatings and flavour release. Products reformulated for fat reduction are particularly dependent on hydrocolloids for satisfactory sensory quality. They now also find increasing applications in the health area as dietary fibre of low calorific value. The first edition of Handbook of Hydrocolloids provided professionals in the food industry with relevant practical information about the range of hydrocolloid ingredients readily and at the same time authoritatively. It was exceptionally well received and has subsequently been used as the substantive reference on these food ingredients. Extensively revised and expanded and containing eight new chapters, this major new edition strengthens that reputation. Edited by two leading international authorities in the field, the second edition reviews over twenty-five hydrocolloids, covering structure and properties, processing, functionality, applications and regulatory status. Since there is now greater emphasis on the protein hydrocolloids, new chapters on vegetable proteins and egg protein have been added. Coverage of microbial polysaccharides has also been increased and the developing role of the exudate gums recognised, with a new chapter on Gum Ghatti. Protein-polysaccharide complexes are finding increased application in food products and a new chapter on this topic as been added. Two additional chapters reviewing the role of hydrocolloids in emulsification and their role as dietary fibre and subsequent health benefits are also included.

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the plausible binding modes of mangiferin to key enzymes linked to diabetes type 2 (DT2), obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and urolithiasis using molecular docking. Method: Crystallographic structures of α-Amylase, α-glucosidase, glycogen phosphorylase (GP), pancreatic lipase, cholesterol esterase (CEase), angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE), acetyl cholinesterase (AChE), and urease available on the Protein Databank database were docked to mangiferin using Gold 6.0 software. Results: We showed that mangiferin bound to all enzymes by φ-φ and hydrogen bonds mostly. Mangiferin was docked to both allosteric and orthosteric sites of α-glucosidase by φ-φ interactions. However, several hydrogen bonds were observed at the orthosteric position, suggesting a preference for this site. The docking of mangiferin on AChE with the catalytic pocket occupied by paraoxon could be attributed to φ-φ stacking involving amino acid residues, Trp341 and Trp124. Conclusion: This study provided an insight of the molecular interaction of mangiferin with the studied enzymes and can be considered as a valuable tool for designing new drugs for better management of these diseases.}

  abstract = {The present paper aims at reviewing and commenting on the analytical methods applied to antioxidant and antioxidant capacity assessment in plant-derived products. Aspects related to oxidative stress, reactive oxidative species' influence on key biomolecules, and antioxidant benefits and modalities of action are discussed. Also, the oxidant-antioxidant balance is critically discussed. The conventional and nonconventional extraction procedures applied prior to analysis are also presented, as the extraction step is of pivotal importance for isolation and concentration of the compound(s) of interest before analysis. Then, the chromatographic, spectrometric, and electrochemical methods for antioxidant and antioxidant capacity determination in plant-derived products are detailed with respect to their principles, characteristics, and specific applications. Peculiarities related to the matrix characteristics and other factors influencing the method's performances are discussed. Health benefits of plants and derived products are described, as indicated in the original source. Finally, critical and conclusive aspects are given when it comes to the choice of a particular extraction procedure and detection method, which should consider the nature of the sample, prevalent antioxidant/antioxidant class, and the mechanism underlying each technique. Advantages and disadvantages are discussed for each method.}

  abstract = {This review will focus on the impact of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in the development of diabetes-related neural dysfunction. Oxidative stress occurs when the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cells or tissues to detoxify the free radicals produced during metabolic activity is tilted in the favor of the former. Although hyperglycemia plays a key role in inducing oxidative stress in the diabetic nerve, the contribution of other factors, such as endoneurial hypoxia, transition metal imbalances, and hyperlipidemia have been also suggested. The possible sources for the overproduction of ROS in diabetes are widespread and include enzymatic pathways, auto-oxidation of glucose, and mitochondrial superoxide production. Increase in oxidative stress has clearly been shown to contribute to the pathology of neural and vascular dysfunction in diabetes. Potential therapies for preventing increased oxidative stress in diabetic nerve dysfunction will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with synaptic plasticity, which is crucial for long-term learning and memory. Some studies suggest that people suffering from anxiety disorders show reduced BDNF relative to healthy controls. Lower BDNF is associated with impaired learning, cognitive deficits, and poor exposure-based treatment outcomes. A series of studies with rats showed that exercise elevates BDNF and enhances fear extinction. However, this strategy has not been tested in humans. In this pilot study, we randomized participants (N = 9, 8 females, M(Age) = 34) with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to (a) prolonged exposure alone (PE) or (b) prolonged exposure+exercise (PE+E). Participants randomized to the PE+E condition completed a 30-minute bout of moderate-intensity treadmill exercise (70\% of age-predicted HR(max)) prior to each PE session. Consistent with prediction, the PE+E group showed a greater improvement in PTSD symptoms (d = 2.65) and elevated BDNF (d = 1.08) relative to the PE only condition. This pilot study provides initial support for further investigation into exercise augmented exposure therapy.},

(PA) on ethanol-induced rat hepatic injury. In the in vitro study, PA (1-4 mg/ml) increased \%MTT reduction assay and decreased the release of transaminases (AST and ALT) in rat primary cultured hepatocytes being treated with ethanol. Hepatotoxic parameters studied in vivo included serum transaminases (AST and ALT), serum triglyceride (STG), hepatic triglyceride (HTG), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), together with histopathological examination. In acute toxicity study, single dose of PA (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg, p.o.) or SL (silymarin, a reference hepatoprotective agent, 5 mg/kg), 24 h before ethanol (5 g/kg, p.o.) lowered the ethanol-induced levels of transaminases (AST and/or ALT). The 75 mg/kg PA dose gave the best result similar to SL. Treatment of rats with PA (75 mg/(kg day), p.o.) or SL (5 g/(kg day), p.o.) for 7 days after 21 days with ethanol (4 g/(kg day), p.o.) enhanced liver cell recovery by bringing the levels of AST, ALT, HTG and TNF-α back to normal. Histopathological observations confirmed the beneficial roles of PA and SL against ethanol-induced liver injury in rats.

The encapsulation ability of the final mixtures was evaluated based on their microencapsulating efficiency (EE) of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and the physicochemical properties of freeze-dried powders. Results showed that the freeze-dried powders produced using two encapsulants have a lower moisture content, but higher solubility, Carr index, and Hausner ratio than freeze-dried powders produced using only one encapsulant in the formulation. The microencapsulating efficiency of TPC also varied depending on encapsulants used. The lowest EE\% of TPC was determined with maltodextrin (21.17\%), and the highest with sodium caseinate (83.02\%). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that freeze-drying resulted in the formation of different size, irregular shape glassy particles. This study demonstrated good mucoadhesive properties of freeze-dried powders, which could be incorporated in buccal or oral delivery dosage forms. In conclusion, the microencapsulation of E. ciliata ethanolic extract by freeze-drying is an effective method to produce new value-added pharmaceutical or food formulations with polyphenols.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine if Panax notoginseng is effective in reducing pain, indicators of inflammation and muscle damage, and in turn improve performance in well trained males who underwent a bout of eccentric exercise designed to induce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Design: A double blind randomised placebo controlled trial. Setting: Twenty well trained male volunteers, matched by maximum aerobic capacity were randomly assigned to consume a regime of 4000. mg of P. notoginseng capsules or an indistinguishable placebo before and after a downhill treadmill running episode designed to induce DOMS. Main outcome measures: Performance measures (Kin-Com, counter movement and squat jump), pain assessments (visual analogue scale (VAS), algometer) and blood analyses (interleukin-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein, myoglobin, creatine kinase) were assessed at 7 time points over 5 days (pre, post, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96. h after the downhill run). Results: The placebo group demonstrated a significant decrease in squat jump performance immediately post the downhill run, with a mean change. ±. 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.8. cm (-3.53 to 1.93). The placebo group also experienced increased pain in the quadriceps 96. h after the downhill run, with a mean VAS change. ±. 95\% CI of -0.32. cm (-0.34 to 0.98).The serum concentration of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly lower in the placebo group 24. h after the downhill run. Mean IL-6 change. ±. 95\% CI of 0.50. pg/mL (-1.59 to 0.59), and mean TNF-α change. ±. 95\% CI was 0.98. pg/mL (-2.04 to 0.09). No other significant differences were identified between the groups for any other outcome measure. Conclusion: Considering all data from this study, P. notoginseng did not convincingly have an effect on performance, muscular pain or assessed blood markers in well-trained males after an intense bout of eccentric exercise that induced DOMS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The analysis was performed on an Eprogen Synchropak WAX column (4.6 × 250 mm, 6 μm) with 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 aqueous solution isocratic elution. The method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, stability, and accuracy. It was found that the calibration curve for dencichine showed good linearity (R 2 = 0.9999) within the test range. The LOD and LOQ were 0.77 and 3.06 ng, respectively. The RSD for intra- and interday repeatability was 0.2 and 0.5\%, respectively. The test solution of dencichine is stable at least for three days at room temperature and for seven days at 4°C. The mean recovery of dencichine was 102.0\%. The established method was successfully applied to determine dencichine in the raw root of P. nogoginseng, P. ginseng, and P. quinquefolium as well as the steamed root of P. notoginseng. Compared with previous reports, this method is sensitive, selective, and accurate, which is helpful to evaluate the quality of P. notoginseng and related species. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  \&  Co.

  abstract = {Citronellal (CT) is a monoterpenoid and the major constituent of the mixture of terpenoids that give the citronella oil its lemon scent. Citronella oil is widely used around the world for various purposes and is mainly obtained from plants of the Cymbopogon genus, which are known as ‘‘lemongrass.’’ Considering these plants have been used worldwide for various medicinal purposes, the interest of researchers to understand the biological activities of monoterpenoids related to the Cymbopogon genus has been increasing. In the present work, we investigated the antinociceptive action and the redox properties of CT. Our results indicate that intraperitoneal injection of CT was effective in reducing nociceptive face-rubbing behavior in both phases of the formalin test, which was also naloxone-sensitive. CT also evoked antinociceptive response in the capsaicin and glutamate tests. The total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter and total antioxidant reactivity assays indicate that CT at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg=mL exerts a significant antioxidant activity, which is probably related to its ability to scavenge superoxide and nitric oxide, but not H2O2 or hydroxyl radicals, as evaluated separately by specific in vitro tests. These results show for the first time the antinociceptive potential of CT and indicate that the antioxidant properties of this compound may rely on its mechanism of biological actions because CT-containing natural products are used to treat various diseases related to oxidative stress and reactive species.},

In previous studies some derivatives of sesquiterpene lactones were prepared to be tested as antiviral and/or cytoxic agents. In the present report we describe the effects of seven modified sesquiterpene lactones on the proliferation of several cancer cell lines. We demonstrated antitumoral activity of two of them: III (JLNZ-106) and IV (EDAG-IV-Sme) in HeLa, C-33, CALO, INBL, VIPA, SW480, SW620, MCF-7 and CHO cancer cell lines. Compounds III (JLNZ-106) and IV (EDAG-IV-Sme-IV) presented cytotoxic activity (IC50) by inhibiting the incorporation of (14)C-thymidine to DNA. These experiments suggest that derivatives III and IV should inhibit DNA replication in cancer cell lines.},

All the untreated rats died of tumour burden by 33.7 ± 1.6 weeks. Administration of P. amarus extract (150 mg/kg b.w.) after tumour development increased the survival of animals to an average of 52.2 ± 2.3 weeks. Serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity which was elevated to 182 ± 23 U/l by NDEA administration was lowered to 112 ± 19 U/l by the administration of P. amarus extract. Similarly elevated glutathione S-transferase activity (1534 ± 116 nmol/min per mg protein) and glutathione (20.5 ± 2.4 nmol/mg protein) levels in the NDEA administered group were found to be lowered to 1112 ± 89 nmol/min per mg protein and 14.2 ± 2.2 nmol/mg protein respectively.

The neurotoxin was detected in the CNS of the acidotic monkey and also in the normal monkey in nearly the same quantity. The neurotoxin was largely localised in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord. The amount of radioactive ODAP in the CNS following its intraperitoneal injection was twice that seen following its intravenous injection. The concentrations of the neurotoxin 90 min after injection in the CNS of the adult rat and the day old chick were almost the same and increased 2 fold by 24 h. No radioactive metabolite of ODAP could be detected in either the tissues or the urine of the different species. Species (and age) differences in susceptibility to the L. sativus neurotoxin is thus independent of its entry into the CNS. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved}

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus infection is a major health problem worldwide. Developing effective antiviral therapy for HCV is the need of the hour. The viral enzymes NS3 protease and NS5B RNA dependent RNA polymerase are essential enzymes for polyprotein processing and viral RNA replication and thus can be potential targets for screening anti-HCV compounds. A large number of phytochemicals are present in plants, which are found to be promising antiviral agents. In this study, we have screened inhibitory effect of different plant extracts against the NS3 and NS5B enzymes of hepatitis C virus. Methanolic extracts were prepared from various plant materials and their inhibitory effects on the viral enzymes were determined by in vitro enzyme assays. Effect on viral RNA replication was investigated by using TaqMan Real time RT-PCR. Interestingly, Phyllanthus amarus root (PAR) extract showed significant inhibition of HCV-NS3 protease enzyme; whereas P. amarus leaf (PAL) extract showed considerable inhibition of NS5B in the in vitro assays. Further, the PAR and PAL extracts significantly inhibited replication of HCV monocistronic replicon RNA and HCV H77S viral RNA in HCV cell culture system. However, both PAR and PAL extracts did not show cytotoxicity in Huh7 cells in the MTT assay. Furthermore, addition of PAR together with IFN-α showed additive effect in the inhibition of HCV RNA replication. Results suggest the possible molecular basis of the inhibitory activity of PA extract against HCV which would help in optimization and subsequent development of specific antiviral agent using P. amarus as potent natural source. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The genus Centaurea is recognized in folk medicine for anti-inflammatory, anti-itch, antitussive, purgative, astringent, and tonic activities. To study the chemical determinant for antimicrobial activity essential oils (EOs), five Centaurea species were analyzed including: C. scoparia, C. calcitrapa, C. glomerata, C. lipii and C. alexandrina. Conventional hydro-distillation (HD) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), as new green technologies, were compared for the extraction of essential oils. GC/MS analysis identified 120 EOs including mostly terpenoid except from C. lipii and C. alexandrina in which nonterpenoids were the major constituents. Major terpenoids included spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide and alloaromadendrene oxide-2. To probe antibacterial activity, potential EO inhibitors of a bacterial type II DNA topoisomerase, DNA gyrase B were screened via an in silico molecular docking approach. Spathulenol and alloaromadendrene oxide-2 possessed the best binding affinity in the ATP- binding pocket of Gyrase B enzyme. Principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were used for sample classification and revealed that sesquiterpenes contributed the most for accessions classification. In vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger for all EOs were also evaluated. EOs from C. lipii, C. glomerata and C. calcitrapa exhibited significant MIC against S. aureus with an MIC value of 31.25 µg/mL.},

  abstract = {The spectacular recent progress in Arabidopsis thaliana molecular genetics furnishes outstanding tools for studying the formation and function of all metabolites in this cruciferous species. One of the major groups of secondary metabolites in A. thaliana is the glucosinolates. These hydrophilic, sulfur-rich glycosides appear to serve as defenses against some generalist herbivores and pathogens, and as feeding and oviposition stimulants to specialist herbivores. To help study their biosynthesis and role in plant-insect interactions, we wanted to determine the complete glucosinolate content of A. thaliana. In previous studies, 24 glucosinolates had been identified from ecotype Columbia. We reinvestigated Columbia as well as additional ecotypes and mutant lines, and identified 12 further glucosinolates, including five novel compounds. Structures were elucidated by MS and NMR spectroscopy of their desulfated derivatives, and by enzymatic cleavage of the attached ester moieties. Four of the novel glucosinolates are benzoate esters isolated from the seeds. In all but one of these compounds, esterification is on the glucose moiety rather than the side chain, a very unusual feature for glucosinolates. Among additional glucosinolates identified were the first non-chain elongated, methionine-derived glucosinolate from A. thaliana and the first compounds that appear to be derived from leucine. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

By that intake of hesperidin regulates the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism by decreasing the cholesterols in blood and plasma insulin by hyperlipidamic and anti-hyperglycemic activity. The rats turns to diabetic with single intraperitonial STZ injection (50\,mg/kg BW), and from the second week the rats diet were switched to a high fat diet, i.e., cholesterol (40\%), fat (50\%), Protein (50\%) turns to be hyperlipidamic rats and with Isoproterenol (ISO) single intraperitoneal injection by the (11~mg/kg BW) turns to DMI rats. The DMI rats fed with the hesperidin 100mg/kg BW for 4 weeks had significantly reduced the blood glucose (P~{$<~$}0.05), total cholesterol (TC), Triglycerides, HDL, LDL and VLDL concentrations, when compared with experimental groups (p~{$<~$}0.05). A significantly increased blood glucose and body weight was observed in hesperidin treated diabetic groups (P~{$<~$}0.05) by comparing with the experimental groups. In conclusion, orally supplementation of hesperidin possesses a significant decrease in total blood lipid profiles and plasma insulin concentrations accompanied by the anti-hyperglycemic, hypo-lipidemic activity in DMI rats.}

Several linalool-producing species are used in traditional medical systems. Among these is Aeolanthus suaveolens G. Dom (Labiatae) which is used as an anticonvulsant in the Brazilian Amazon. Psychopharmacological in vivo evaluation of linalool showed that this compound has dose-dependent marked sedative effects at the central nervous system (CNS), including hypnotic, anticonvulsant and hypothermic properties. It has been suggested that these neurochemical effects might be ascribed to the local anaesthetic activity of linalool. The present study reports an inhibitory effect of linalool on the acetylcholine (ACh) release and on the channel open time in the mouse neuromuscular junction. These findings could provide a rational basis to confirm the traditional medical use of linalool-producing plant species. Indeed, our data demonstrate some interactions in the modulation of the ACh release at the mouse neuromuscular junction, which are well correlated with the suggested molecular mechanisms. Linalool induced a reduction of the ACh-evoked release. The possibility that this effect could be ascribed to some interaction with pre-synaptic function is noteworthy. Moreover, the inhibitory effect induced on the kinetics of the miniature end-plate current decay demonstrates a local anaesthetic action, either on the voltage or on the receptor-activated channels.},

Therefore, the immunomodulatory effects of the herbal extract Panax notoginseng on cultured macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) were investigated to address potential therapeutic or toxic effects. Cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and treated with notoginseng at 5, 25 and 50 μg/ml. Notoginseng inhibited the LPS-induced production of TNF-α and IL-6 by the cultured macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. The expression of COX-2 and IL-1β mRNA was also attenuated by notoginseng. TNF-α production was inhibited in samples treated with notoginseng 24 h before, or at the same time as LPS stimulation, but not in samples treated 8 h after LPS stimulation. Notoginseng reduced expression of the accessory molecules CD40 and CD86 on the RAW264.7 cells while CD14 and TLR4 expression remained unaffected. Furthermore, Rb1 and Rg1 ginsenosides also inhibited macrophage production of TNF-α, but to a lesser extent than did the whole notoginseng extract. Collectively, these results indicate that notoginseng inhibits LPS-induced activation of RAW264.7 macrophages and demonstrates that notoginseng possesses anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties in vitro. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the regulation of both inflammation and adaptive immunity. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for notoginseng extracts to modulate Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-induced activation of cultured DC2.4 cells. Following stimulation with LPS, CpG or poly(I:C) and treatment with 0-50 μg/ml notoginseng extract for 24 h, DCs were evaluated for various phenotypic and functional readouts. Notoginseng reduced the LPS-, CpG- and poly(I:C)-induced production of TNF-α by DC2.4 cells. Also, IL-6 production by notoginseng-treated cells stimulated with LPS and CpG but not poly(I:C) was reduced when compared to controls. TLR ligand-induced CD40 expression was attenuated by notoginseng. In contrast, notoginseng decreased CD86 levels on DCs activated with LPS and poly(I:C) but not CpG. Inhibition of TNF-α production was time-dependent in LPS-stimulated cells, occurring only with pretreatment or concurrent treatment of notoginseng but not after delayed addition of the herbal extract. Additionally, ginsenoside Rg1 more effectively inhibited LPS-stimulated cytokine production by DC2.4 cells than ginsenoside Rb1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that notoginseng inhibits the production of specific inflammatory molecules and innate immune responsiveness by DCs following TLR activation. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract = {Hyperglycemia resulting from uncontrolled glucose regulation is widely recognized as the causal link between diabetes and diabetic complications. Four major molecular mechanisms have been implicated in hyperglycemia-induced tissue damage: activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms via de novo synthesis of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), increased hexosamine pathway flux, increased advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation, and increased polyol pathway flux. Hyperglycemia-induced overproduction of superoxide is the causal link between high glucose and the pathways responsible for hyperglycemic damage. In fact, diabetes is typically accompanied by increased production of free radicals and/or impaired antioxidant defense capabilities, indicating a central contribution for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the onset, progression, and pathological consequences of diabetes. Besides oxidative stress, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated a link between various disturbances in mitochondrial functioning and type 2 diabetes. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and decreases in mtDNA copy number have been linked to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The study of the relationship of mtDNA to type 2 diabetes has revealed the influence of the mitochondria on nuclear-encoded glucose transporters, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and nuclear-encoded uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in β-cell glucose toxicity. This review focuses on a range of mitochondrial factors important in the pathogenesis of diabetes. We review the published literature regarding the direct effects of hyperglycemia on mitochondrial function and suggest the possibility of regulation of mitochondrial function at a transcriptional level in response to hyperglycemia. The main goal of this review is to include a fresh consideration of pathways involved in hyperglycemia-induced diabetic complications. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Seventy-six adults aged between 40 and 65 years took part in a double-blind randomized, placebo control study in which various memory functions were tested and levels of anxiety measured. There were three testing sessions: one prior to the trial, one after three months on the trial, and one six weeks after the completion of the trial. The results show a significant effect of the Brahmi on a test for the retention of new information. Follow-up tests showed that the rate of learning was unaffected, suggesting that Brahmi decreases the rate of forgetting of newly acquired information. Tasks assessing attention, verbal and visual short-term memory and the retrieval of pre-experimental knowledge were unaffected. Questionnaire measures of everyday memory function and anxiety levels were also unaffected. © 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

  abstract = {Following its benchmark discovery, nitric oxide (NO) is now known to play important functional roles in a variety of physiological systems. Within the vasculature, NO induces vasodilation, inhibits platelet aggregation, prevents neutrophil/platelet adhesion to endothelial cells, inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, regulates programmed cell death (apoptosis) and maintains endothelial cell barrier function. NO generated by neurons acts as a neurotransmitter, whereas NO generated by macrophages in response to invading microbes acts as an antimicrobial agent. Because neurons, blood vessels and cells of the immune system are integral parts of the reproductive organs, and in view of the important functional role that NO plays in those systems, it is likely that NO is an important regulator of the biology and physiology of the reproductive system. Indeed, in the past 10 years, NO has established itself as a polyvalent molecule which plays a decisive role in regulating multiple functions within the female as well as the male reproductive system. This review provides an overview of the role of NO in various reproductive organs under physiological and pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {With the advances in computational resources, there is an increasing urge among the computational researchers to make the in silico approaches fast, convenient, reproducible, acceptable, and sensible ones. Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand–receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds. VS serves as an efficient computational tool that integrates structural data with lead optimization as a cost-effective approach to drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Background Modern medicine often clashes with traditional medicine such as Chinese herbal medicine because of the little understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of the herbs. In an effort to promote integration of both sides and to accelerate the drug discovery from herbal medicines, an efficient systems pharmacology platform that represents ideal information convergence of pharmacochemistry, ADME properties, drug-likeness, drug targets, associated diseases and interaction networks, are urgently needed. Description The traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) was built based on the framework of systems pharmacology for herbal medicines. It consists of all the 499 Chinese herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopoeia with 29,384 ingredients, 3,311 targets and 837 associated diseases. Twelve important ADME-related properties like human oral bioavailability, half-life, drug-likeness, Caco-2 permeability, blood-brain barrier and Lipinski’s rule of five are provided for drug screening and evaluation. TCMSP also provides drug targets and diseases of each active compound, which can automatically establish the compound-target and target-disease networks that let users view and analyze the drug action mechanisms. It is designed to fuel the development of herbal medicines and to promote integration of modern medicine and traditional medicine for drug discovery and development. Conclusions The particular strengths of TCMSP are the composition of the large number of herbal entries, and the ability to identify drug-target networks and drug-disease networks, which will help revealing the mechanisms of action of Chinese herbs, uncovering the nature of TCM theory and developing new herb-oriented drugs.

Here, we report that the ethanol extract of Diospyros kaki (EEDK) exhibits protective properties against retinal degeneration, both in vitro and in vivo. Upon exposure to cytotoxic compounds, RGC-5 cells showed approximately 40\% cell viability versus the control, while pre-treatment with EEDK markedly increased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that cell survival induced by EEDK was associated with decreased levels of apoptotic proteins, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, p53, and cleaved caspase-3. In addition to apoptotic pathways, we demonstrated that expression levels of antioxidant-associated proteins, such as superoxide dismutase-1, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase-1, were positively modulated by EEDK. In a partial optic nerve crush mouse model, EEDK had similar ameliorating effects on retinal degeneration resulting from mechanical damages. Therefore, our results suggest that EEDK may have therapeutic potential against retinal degenerative disorders, such as glaucoma.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Capsaicin ion channels are highly expressed in peripheral nervous terminals and involved in pain and thermal sensations. One characteristic of the cloned VR1 receptor is its multimodal responses to various types of noxious stimuli. The channel is independently activated by capsaicin and related vanilloids at submicromolar range, by heat above 40°C, and by protons at pH below 6.5. Furthermore, simultaneous applications of two or more stimuli lead to cross sensitization of the receptor, with an apparent increase in the sensitivity to any individual stimulus when applied alone. We studied here the mechanism underlying such cross-sensitization; in particular, between capsaicin and pH, two prototypical stimuli for the channel. By analyzing single-channel currents recorded from excised-patches expressing single recombinant VR1 receptors, we examined the effect of pH on burst properties of capsaicin activation at low concentrations and the effect on gating kinetics at high concentrations. Our results indicate that pH has dual effects on both capsaicin binding and channel gating. Lowering pH enhances the apparent binding affinity of capsaicin, promotes the occurrences of long openings and short closures, and stabilizes at least one of the open conformations of the channel. Our data also demonstrate that capsaicin binding and protonation of the receptor interact allosterically, where the effect of one can be offset by the effect of the other. These results provide important basis to further understand the nature of the activation pathways of the channel evoked by different stimuli as well as the general mechanism underling the cross-sensitization of pain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For determination of the IC50 values of the extracts (± 95 \% CI), a linear regression was performed using Origin® (Origin® 2015G von Origin Lab Corporation, Northampton, MA 01060 USA).Results: The aqueous extract of black tea presented the strongest inhibitory activity with an IC50-value (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 13.0 (11.0-15.3) µg/mL. The tested food extracts were successful in inhibiting the GABA-degrading enzymes even at low concentrations. Conclusion: In conclusion, the selected food extracts could serve as natural inhibitors for GABA-degrading enzymes thus, they could increase the GABA concentration in the brain.},

Presently, the standardized methanolic extract of Bacopa monniera (bacoside A - 38.0+/-0.9) was investigated for potential antidepressant activity in rodent models of depression. The effect was compared with the standard antidepressant drug imipramine (15 mg/kg, ip). The extract when given in the dose of 20 and 40 mg/kg, orally once daily for 5 days was found to have significant antidepressant activity in forced swim and learned helplessness models of depression and was comparable to that of imipramine.},

The systematic search for natural sources to obtain valuable molecules to develop products with commercial value and industrial purposes remains the most challenging task in bioprospecting. Virtual screening strategies have innovated the discovery of novel bioactive molecules assessing in silico large compound libraries, favoring the analysis of their chemical space, pharmacodynamics, and their pharmacokinetic properties, thus leading to the reduction of financial efforts, infrastructure, and time involved in the process of discovering new chemical entities. Herein, we discuss the computational approaches and methods developed to explore the chemo-structural diversity of natural products, focusing on the main paradigms involved in the discovery and screening of bioactive compounds from natural sources, placing particular emphasis on artificial intelligence, cheminformatics methods, and big data analyses.},

A solvent evaporation method was used to prepare the SBE-phospholipid complex (Bacopa Naturosome, BN). The formulation and process variables were optimized using a central-composite design. The formation of BN was confirmed by photomicroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD). The saturation solubility, the in-vitro dissolution, and the ex-vivo permeability studies were used for the functional evaluation of the prepared complex. BN exhibited a significantly higher aqueous solubility compared to the pure SBE (20-fold), or the physical mixture of SBE and the phospholipid (13-fold). Similarly, the in-vitro dissolution revealed a significantly higher efficiency of the prepared complex (BN) in releasing the SBE ({$>$} 97\%) in comparison to the pure SCE (\textasciitilde{} 42\%), or the physical mixture (\textasciitilde{} 47\%). The ex-vivo permeation studies showed that the prepared BN significantly improved the permeation of SBE ({$>$} 90\%), compared to the pure SBE (\textasciitilde{} 21\%), or the physical mixture (\textasciitilde{} 24\%). Drug-phospholipid complexation may thus be a promising strategy for solubility enhancement of bioactive phytoconstituents.},

  abstract = {On many occasions, a system (an industrial process, a method of analysis, a synthesis, etc.) is in operation and the researcher wonders about the possibility of improving the results by only changing the values of the parameters that control the operation of the system. This demands exploration of an admissible region of the space where the parameters vary. This involves two stages: (i) to experiment in some points of this region and to obtain the results, and (ii) to make a prediction of the results that would be obtained in the rest of the points by evaluating the reliability of this prediction. After that, the researcher will know if the results from his/her system can be improved, and to what extent and the values of the parameters that will have to be used for it.The response surface methodology (RSM) is, above all, a collection of criteria to decide in what points of the feasible region the experimentation should be made, in such a way that the prediction is most precise (whenever possible). Once the researcher has defined the problem, the domain of experimentation and the response, the RSM provides, on the one hand, alternative experimental strategies and, on the other hand, the criteria to evaluate them. The great advantage is that this task of adapting the experimentation to the problem under study is accomplished before carrying out the experiments.Following this point of view, the focus of this chapter is on the criteria and the methodology rather than the detailed list of designs already described in the literature, which in most of the cases are specially adapted to a specific problem. This chapter is thus an introduction to exploration and optimization of response surfaces by fitting an empirical model to some experimental data. In Section 1.12.2, the elements of the RSM are defined. In Section 1.12.3, the most important optimality criteria based on the variance are exposed. The statistical validation of the empirical model is discussed in Section 1.12.4, and in Section 1.12.5 the most often used designs for the fitting of the first- and second-order models are described. The methods for the analysis of the fitted response surface model are discussed in Section 1.12.6. The chapter concludes with some consideration about the practical use of the RSM and bibliographic references are given for more advanced questions, impossible to be tackled in a single chapter.Nowadays, there are several efficient programs that allow the researcher to adapt…},

  abstract = {The functional food market is growing with a compound annual growth rate of 7.9\%. Thai food recipes use several kinds of herbs. Lemongrass, garlic, and turmeric are ingredients used in Thai curry paste. Essential oils released in the preparation step create the flavor and fragrance of the famous tom yum and massaman dishes. While the biological activities of these ingredients have been investigated, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the responses to the essential oils of these plants. To investigate the effects of essential oil inhalation on the brain and mood responses, electroencephalography was carried out during the non-task resting state, and self-assessment of the mood state was performed. The essential oils were prepared in several dilutions in the range of the supra-threshold level. The results show that Litsea cubeba oil inhalation showed a sedative effect, observed from alpha and beta wave power reductions. The frontal and temporal regions of the brain were involved in the wave alterations. Garlic oil increased the alpha wave power at lower concentrations; however, a sedative effect was also observed at higher concentrations. Lower dilution oil induced changes in the fast alpha activity in the frontal region. The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased with higher dilution oils, particularly in the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Both Litsea cubeba and turmeric oils resulted in better positive moods than garlic oil. Garlic oil caused more negative moods than the others. The psychophysiological activities and the related brain functions require further investigation. The knowledge obtained from this study may be used to design functional food products.},

  abstract = {Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, ginseng) has been the most precious and renowned tonic drug in traditional Chinese medicine. Although the original discovery of its therapeutic efficacy has been lost in antiquity, believers in ginseng as a panacea have sought, cultivated, preserved and extracted its essences for the treatment of a wide range of ailments. Many patients have used aqueous and alcoholic extracts of ginseng during convalescence, particularly where previous health problem(s) resulted in some degree of debilitation, and a corresponding deficit in mental, physical or other functional capacities. An impressive body of information has been accumulated and scientific research has documented and reviewed the useful effects of P. ginseng C.A. Meyer. The high variability in composition of the marketed products clearly affects the results of clinical studies. The availability of the standardised ginseng extract G115 has made it possible to generate reproducible results in animal studies and human clinical research. Active constituents found in most ginseng species include ginsenosides, polysaccharides, peptides, polyacetylenic alcohols, fatty acids and trace elements. It is generally believed that ginsenosides and their metabolites are the most important components determining the pharmacological effects of ginseng. Ginsenosides are triterpene saponins of the dammaran series. They are divided into three groups, classified according to their chemical structures: 20(S)-protopanaxadiols, 20(S)-protopanaxatriols and the RO ginsenosides. The variability in the pharmacological activities of the various ginseng species may be related to the different composition of proportions of ginsenosides. One of the most common standardised extracts, used in many studies, is G115, which contains 4\% ginsenosides. In view of the wide variations, both qualitative and quantitative, standardisation must control the total amount of ginsenosides. Several clinical studies have been conducted with the standardised P. ginseng extract G115. Here we briefly review only double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that are judged to be of scientific relevance for the clinical profile of the product. The efficacy of G115 on physical performance still needs to be confirmed in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) settings. Several clinical studies with ginseng have not shown any significant effect on the enhancement of physical performance. The ability of G115 to increase endurance and vitality, on the other hand, has been demonstrated in a number of non-GCP studies. The efficacy of G115 in relieving menopausal symptoms is supported by two studies, one of GCP quality. Efficacy in improving cognitive function has been extensively reviewed. Intake of G115 in acute and multiple doses is associated with improvements in cognitive function. A series of studies has assessed the effects of G115 in various volunteer populations using a widely validated and highly sensitive computerised cognitive test system, the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) assessment system. Several preclinical studies have indicated that G115 may have immunomodulatory properties. These findings have been confirmed in two clinical studies. The efficacy and safety of G115 for potentiating vaccination against the common cold and/or influenza syndrome in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study were determined. Moreover, the effects of G115 in reducing the bacterial count in the bronchial system of patients undergoing an acute attack of chronic bronchitis has been investigated in an open pilot study. The safety profile of G115 has been well established both from clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients and from its use for over 30 years as a marketed medicinal product in many countries worldwide. Few clinical studies on G115 report adverse effects. In general, the lack of reported adverse effects suggests that they are few, and those present are very minor. On the other hand, a baseline level of adverse effects should be expected and is always presen , even for placebo groups in clinical trials. A total of 1075 subjects have been treated with G115 to date in clinical trials. Seventy-one subjects experienced minor adverse effects but no serious events were reported. The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, itching, sore throat, skin rash, dry mouth, acne and diarrhoea, with no difference between placebo and G115. In all trials, no changes in safety laboratory parameters were seen. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors offer new options for the management of type 2 diabetes. Direct comparisons with active glucose-lowering comparators in drug-naive patients have demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibitors exert slightly less pronounced HbA 1c reduction than metformin (with the advantage of better gastrointestinal tolerability) and similar glucose-lowering effects as with a thiazolidinedione (TZD; with the advantage of no weight gain). In metformin-treated patients, gliptins were associated with similar HbA 1c reductions compared with a sulphonylurea (SU; with the advantage of no weight gain, considerably fewer hypoglycaemic episodes and no need for titration) and a TZD (with the advantage of no weight gain and better overall tolerability). DPP-4 inhibitors also exert clinically relevant glucose-lowering effects compared with a placebo in patients treated with SU or TZD (of potential interest when metformin is either not tolerated or contraindicated), and as oral triple therapy with a good tolerability profile when added to a metformin-SU or pioglitazone-SU combination. Several clinical trials also showed a consistent reduction in HbA 1c when DPP-4 inhibitors were added to basal insulin therapy, with no increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Because of the complex pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and the complementary actions of glucose-lowering agents, initial combination of a DPP-4 inhibitor with either metformin or a glitazone may be applied in drug-naive patients, resulting in greater efficacy and similar safety compared with either drug as monotherapy. However, DPP-4 inhibitors were less effective than GLP-1 receptor agonists for reducing HbA 1c and body weight, but offer the advantage of being easier to use (oral instead of injected administration) and lower in cost. Only one head-to-head trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of saxagliptin vs sitagliptin. Clearly, more trials of direct comparisons between different incretin-based therapies are needed. Because of their pharmacokinetic characteristics, pharmacodynamic properties (glucose-dependent glucose-lowering effect) and good overall tolerability profile, DPP-4 inhibitors may have a key role to play in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly. The role of DPP-4 inhibitors in the therapeutic armamentarium of type 2 diabetes is rapidly evolving as their potential strengths and weaknesses become better defined mainly through controlled clinical trials. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

  abstract = {Belamcanda chinensis (BC) belongs to the family of iridaceae and the isoflavone tectorigenin has been isolated from the rhizome of this plant. Whether this isoflavone has estrogenic, possibly selective estrogen receptor modulator activities and if so, whether they are mediated via the estrogen receptor α or β is unknown at present. Therefore, we performed binding studies with recombinant human ERα and ERβ to show that tectorigenin binds to both receptor subtypes. In ERα-expressing MCF7 and ERβ-expressing MDA-MB231 reporter gene transfected cells tectorigenin causes transactivation. When given intravenously to ovariectomized (ovx) rats, it inhibits pulsatile pituitary LH secretion. In postmenopausal women estrogen-unopposed LH pulses correlate with hot flushes. Therefore, suppression of pulsatile LH secretion may be beneficial in women suffering from hot flushes. Upon chronic application to ovx rats a BC extract containing 5\% Belamcanda at a daily dose of 33 mg or 130 mg of the extract had no effect on uterine weight or on estrogen-regulated uterine gene expression while estrogenic effects in the bone, on bone mineral density of the metaphysis of the tibia could be established. Hence, tectorigenin may have antiosteoporotic effects also in postmenopausal women. Immunohistochemical staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - a proliferation marker - in the mammary gland did not indicate a mammotrophic effect of the tectorigenin-containing BC extract at both tested doses. In summary, tectorigenin or the B. chinensis extract containing tectorigenin had a strong hypothalamotropic and osteotropic effect but no effect in the uterus or the mammary gland. Therefore, tectorigenin may be in the future a clinically useful selective estrogen receptor modulator. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Diabetes mellitus poses serious threat to the global population due to the alarming diabetic complications it leads to. The current therapeutic options available can be improved for better efficiency and maximum benefits. Combination therapy has been commonly used to improve the efficacy and to minimize the side effects of drugs in current clinical use. Purpose: The present study aims to assess the interaction between a natural molecule mangiferin with the commercially available oral hypoglycemic drugs metformin and gliclazide in diabetic rats. Methods: In this study, the in vitro cytotoxicity and glucose uptake studies were performed in HepG2 cells. Based on experimental data, the combination index of the hypoglycemic drugs like metformin and gliclazide in combination with different doses of mangiferin was determined using COMPUSYN software. Further, in vivo studies were performed in HFD + STZ induced diabetic male Sprague Dawley rats. Serum parameters, enzyme markers, hepatic oxidative stress markers, gene and protein expression studies and histopathological analyses were performed in rat liver to identify the mode of action of the combination drug administration. Results: The in vitro studies on HepG2 cells suggest a positive interaction of mangiferin with both metformin and gliclazide at specific concentrations as evidenced by glucose uptake. The hepatic enzymes, oxidative stress markers, carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, gene (AMPK, Akt, ACC β and Glut-2) and protein (PPARα, PPARγ) expression confirmed the results of the in vitro studies. Both the combinations of mangiferin with metformin and mangiferin with gliclazide exhibited potent antidiabetic effect. The combination of mangiferin with metformin was insulin dependent (Akt pathway) whereas the combination of mangiferin and gliclazide was insulin independent (AMPK pathway). Conclusion: The overall results suggest that combination of mangiferin with both metformin and gliclazide alleviates diabetic conditions potentially at specific doses and modulates the adverse effect of high dose of commonly used OHD's. This combination therapy can be translated for its clinical use as a diabetes management strategy.},

This study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of ginger, a medicinal plant, on the tissue antioxidant defence system and lipid peroxidative status in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. An increased reactive oxygen species and insufficient antioxidant activity are associated with diabetes mellitus, which is mainly responsible for diabetic pathogenesis. The role of ginger as antioxidant markers of liver and kidney were investigated. The antioxidant effect of the ginger was compared with glibenclamide, a well-known hypoglycaemic drug. The diabetic rats exhibited lower activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GP. x), and glutathione reductase (GR) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content and higher level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in hepatic and renal tissues as compared with normal rats. The activities of all parameters were found to be increased, except MDA in ginger-treated diabetic rats, in hepatic and renal tissues. Ginger supplementation, for 30 days to diabetic rats, resulted in significant dose-dependent hypoglycaemic and antioxidant activities. These findings suggest that ginger treatment exerts a therapeutic protective effect in diabetes by decreasing oxidative stress, and hepatic and renal damage. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.}

In order to prevent extreme loss of heat sensitive properties when drying herbs, they are normally dried at low temperatures for longer periods of time to preserve these sensory properties. High energy consumption often results from drying herbs over a long period. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L., Umbelliferae) was dehydrated in two different drying units (thin layer convection and microwave dryers) in order to compare the drying and final product quality (color) characteristics. Microwave drying of the coriander foliage was faster than convective drying. The entire drying process took place in the falling rate period for both microwave and convective dried samples. The drying rate for the microwave dried samples ranged from 42.3 to 48.2\% db/min and that of the convective dried samples ranged from 7.1 to 12.5\% db/min. The fresh sample color had the lowest L value at 26.83 with higher L values for all dried samples. The results show that convective thin layer dried coriander samples exhibited a significantly greater color change than microwave dried coriander samples. The color change index values for the microwave dried samples ranged from 2.67 to 3.27 and that of the convective dried samples varied from 4.59 to 6.58.},

However, these extracts did not inhibit tyrosinase activity at the concentration of 100μg/ml.

  abstract = {We previously reported the propensity of Bacopa monnieri (BM) leaf powder to modulate endogenous levels of oxidative stress markers in the brain of prepubertal mice. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with an alcoholic extract of BM (BME) could provide neuroprotection against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-induced oxidative stress under in vitro and in vivo conditions. In chemical systems, BME exhibited multiple free radical scavenging ability. Further, BME pretreatment completely abolished 3-NPA-induced oxidative stress response in brain (striatum, St) mitochondria in vitro. Likewise, pretreatment of dopaminergic (N27 cell lines) cells with BME not only abrogated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, but also offered marked protection against 3-NPA-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings were further validated employing a 3-NPA mice model in vivo. We determined the degree of oxidative stress induction, redox status, enzymic antioxidants, protein oxidation, and cholinergic function in various brain regions of male mice provided with BME for 10~days (prophylaxis) followed by 3-NPA challenge (75~mg/kg~bw/day, i.p.). BME prophylaxis completely prevented 3-NPA-induced oxidative dysfunctions in St and other brain regions. 3-NPA-induced robust elevation of oxidative markers (malondialdehyde levels, ROS generation, hydroperoxide levels and protein carbonyls) in cytosol of brain regions was predominantly abolished among mice given BME prophylaxis. Interestingly, BME prophylaxis also prevented the depletion of reduced glutathione, thiol levels, and perturbations in antioxidant enzymes caused by 3-NPA. Collectively these findings provide evidence on the significant prophylactic neuroprotective efficacy of BME in prepubertal mice brain. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that BME can serve as a useful adjuvant in protecting brain against oxidative-mediated neurodegenerative disorders involving oxidative stress conditions.},

METHOD: Mice were given a dose of 15 mg x kg(-1) doxorubicin ip alone or in combination with 25, 50, 100 mg x kg(-1) PNS ig, 5 days before doxorubicin administration and following 3 days. Cardiotoxic effects were measured by serum levels of dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and activities of antioxidant enzymes in heart tissue. In vitro experiments were performed using embryonic rat heart cell H9C2 to assess the protective effect of PNS (6.25-100 mg x L(-1)) against doxorubicin on cell viability. Anti-tumor efficiency of doxorubicin was evaluated by cytotoxic experiments using three cancer cell lines. RESULT: Pretreatment with PNS significantly lowered the levels of serum LDH, CK and CK-MB, and normalized myocardial superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities. PNS also attenuated the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on the viability of H9C2 cells, but did not compromise its inhibitory effect on proliferation of cancer cells. CONCLUSION: PNS was demonstrated to attenuate doxorubicin-induced myocardial damage without compromising its anti-tumor activity.},

Rat hippocampal NSCs were isolated from post-natal day 1 (P1) rats and cultured in a serum-free medium. The neurospheres were identified by the expressions of nestin, class III β-tublin (Tuj-1) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). The cells were given PNS and subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) as an in vitro model of brain ischemia reperfusion. The proliferation of NSCs was determined by MTT colorimetry, nestin/BrdU immunofluorescent double-labeling and RT-PCR. Differentiation of NSCs was assessed by immunofluorescent double-labeling of nestin/BrdU, nestin/vimentin, and nestin/Tuj-1. The primary cells and the first two passages of cells formed certain amount of neurospheres, the cells derived from a single cell clone also formed neurospheres. Nestin, BrdU, GFAP and Tuj-1-positive cells appeared in those neurospheres. Compared to the control group, PNS significantly promoted NSC proliferation and the expression of nestin/BrdU, and also enhanced Tuj-1, vimentin, and nestin mRNA expressions in hippocampal NSCs. PNS significantly increased area density, optical density and numbers of nestin/BrdU, nestin/vimentin, and nestin/Tuj-1 positive cells following OGD. These results indicate that PNS can promote proliferation and differentiation of hippocampus NCSs in vitro after OGD, suggesting its potential benefits on neurogenesis and neuroregeneration in brain ischemic injury.},

At present it is not known if they are the cause or the consequence of the complications observed. We discuss the chemistry of advanced glycated end-product formation and their patho-biochemistry particularly in relation to the diabetic microvascular complications of retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy as well as their role in the accelerated vasculopathy observed in diabetes. The concept of carbonyl stress as a cause for advanced glycated end-product toxicity is mentioned. We discuss alterations in the concentrations of advanced glycated end-products in the body, particularly in relation to changes occuring with age, diabetes and its complications such as nephropathy. Problems relating to current methods of advanced glycated end-product detection and measurement are highlighted including the lack of a universally established method of detection or unit of measurement. Agents used for the treatment of advanced glycated end-product accumulation are reviewed, with an emphasis on the results of the recent phase III trials using aminoguanidine and diabetes related complications.

  abstract = {Several Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are used in the treatment of insomnia, restlessness, or anxiety. However, mechanisms underlying this effect and scientific proof for their traditional use is scarce. In the present study CHMs were screened for their ability to modulate GABA-induced chloride currents (I GABA), and active principles were isolated thus providing scientific evidence for their use as sedative and/or anxiolytic agents in CM. Herbal drugs were extracted successively with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, methanol and water and further fractionated according to their bioactivity. The obtained extracts, fractions and finally pure compounds were tested for their ability to potentiate I GABA using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique on recombinant α 1β 2γ 2S GABA A receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. From all tested extracts the petroleum ether extract of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. rhizomes showed the strongest I GABA potentiation and was studied in more detail. This led to the isolation of the main components atractylenolide II and III, which seem to be responsible for the observed positive modulation of I GABA (166 ± 12\%, n = 3 and 155 ± 12\%, n = 3, respectively) in vitro. They were more active than the analogous compound atractylenolide I (96 ± 3\%, n = 3) which differs in an additional double binding in position 9, 9a. Furthermore it could be shown that this effect is mediated independently of the benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site. In conclusion, A. macrocephala exerts its in vitro activity on recombinant GABA A receptors mainly through the two sesquiterpene lactones atractylenolide II and III (Fig. 1). This positive allosteric modulation of I GABA may partially be responsible for the traditional ethnopharmacological use of this herbal drug as a sedative. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

The absolute configuration of hypophyllanthin [2] was determined by cd. Neither of these lignans demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity when evaluated with a battery of cultured mammalian cells, but both were found to enhance the cytotoxic response mediated by vinblastine with multidrug-resistant KB cells.

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AMK), a valuable traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been widely used in clinical practice for treating patients with disorders of the digestive system. AMK has shown noteworthy promoting effect on improving gastrointestinal function and immunity, which might represent a promising candidate for the treatment of intestinal mucosa injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of AMK on intestinal mucosal restitution and the underlying mechanisms via intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cell migration model.  MATERIALS AND METHODS A cell migration model of IEC-6 cells was induced by a single-edge razor blade along the diameter of the cell layers in six-well polystyrene plates. After wounding, the cells were grown in control cultures and in cultures containing spermidine (5μM, SPD, reference drug), alpha-difluoromethylornithine (2.5mM, DFMO, polyamine inhibitor), AMK (50, 100, and 200mg/L), DFMO plus SPD and DFMO plus AMK for 12h. The polyamines content was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with pre-column derivatization. The Rho mRNAs expression levels were assessed by Q-RT-PCR. The Rho and non-muscle myosin II proteins expression levels were analyzed by Western blot. The formation and distribution of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers were monitored with immunostaining techniques using specific antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy. Cell migration assay was carried out using inverted microscope and the Image-Pro Plus software. All of these indexes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of AMK.  RESULTS (1) Treatment with AMK caused significant increases in cellular polyamines content and Rho mRNAs and proteins expression levels, as compared to control group. Furthermore, AMK exposure increased non-muscle myosin II protein expression levels and formation of non-muscle myosin II stress fibers, and resulted in an acceleration of cell migration in IEC-6 cells. (2) Depletion of cellular polyamines by DFMO resulted in a decrease of cellular polyamines levels, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, thereby inhibiting IEC-6 cell migration. AMK not only reversed the inhibitory effects of DFMO on the polyamines content, Rho mRNAs and proteins expression, non-muscle myosin II protein formation and distribution, but also restored cell migration to control levels.  CONCLUSIONS The results obtained from this study revealed that AMK significantly stimulates the migration of IEC-6 cells through a polyamine dependent mechanism, which could accelerate the healing of intestinal injury. These findings suggest the potential value of AMK in curing intestinal diseases characterized by injury and ineffective repair of the intestinal mucosa in clinical practice.},

The effect of air-drying temperature on phenolic content and on LCMS profile was also studied. The increase in air-drying temperature reduced the drying time and increased the effective moisture diffusivity. An Arrhenius relation with activation energy values of 22.828 and 43.129 kJ/mol for Phyllanthus niruri and Phyllanthus amarus, respectively, expressed effect of temperature on the diffusivity. The use of air-drying at 70°C increased the availability of some phenolic compounds. However, the higher temperature negatively affected some sensitive components.},

  abstract = {The influence of fragrances such as perfumes and room fresheners on the psychophysiological activities of humans has been known for a long time, and its significance is gradually increasing in the medicinal and cosmetic industries. A fragrance consists of volatile chemicals with a molecular weight of less than 300 Da that humans perceive through the olfactory system. In humans, about 300 active olfactory receptor genes are devoted to detecting thousands of different fragrance molecules through a large family of olfactory receptors of a diverse protein sequence. The sense of smell plays an important role in the physiological effects of mood, stress, and working capacity. Electrophysiological studies have revealed that various fragrances affected spontaneous brain activities and cognitive functions, which are measured by an electroencephalograph (EEG). The EEG is a good temporal measure of responses in the central nervous system and it provides information about the physiological state of the brain both in health and disease. The EEG power spectrum is classified into different frequency bands such as delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz) and gamma (30–50 Hz), and each band is correlated with different features of brain states. A quantitative EEG uses computer software to provide the topographic mapping of the brain activity in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital brain regions. It is well known that decreases of alpha and beta activities and increases of delta and theta activities are associated with brain pathology and general cognitive decline. In the last few decades, many scientific studies were conducted to investigate the effect of inhalation of aroma on human brain functions. The studies have suggested a significant role for olfactory stimulation in the alteration of cognition, mood, and social behavior. This review aims to evaluate the available literature regarding the influence of fragrances on the psychophysiological activities of humans with special reference to EEG changes.},

OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the chronic effects of an extract of B. monniera (Keenmind) on cognitive function in healthy human subjects. METHODS: The study was a double-blind placebo-controlled independent-group design in which subjects were randomly allocated to one of two treatment conditions, B. monniera (300 mg) or placebo. Neuropsychological testing was conducted pre-(baseline) and at 5 and 12 weeks post drug administration. RESULTS: B. monniera significantly improved speed of visual information processing measured by the IT task, learning rate and memory consolidation measured by the AVLT (P{$<$}0.05), and state anxiety (P{$<$}0.001) compared to placebo, with maximal effects evident after 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that B. monniera may improve higher order cognitive processes that are critically dependent on the input of information from our environment such as learning and memory.},

One hundred and seven healthy participants were recruited for this double-blind placebo-controlled independent group design investigation. Sixty-two participants completed the study with 80\% treatment compliance. Neuropsychological testing using the Cognitive Drug Research cognitive assessment system was conducted at baseline and after 90 days of treatment with a special extract of Bacopa monniera (2 x 150 mg KeenMind) or placebo. The Bacopa monniera product significantly improved performance on the 'Working Memory' factor, more specifically spatial working memory accuracy. The number of false-positives recorded in the Rapid visual information processing task was also reduced for the Bacopa monniera group following the treatment period. The current study provides support for the two other published studies reporting cognitive enhancing effects in healthy humans after a 90 day administration of the Bacopa monniera extract. Further studies are required to ascertain the effective dosage range, the time required to attain therapeutic levels and the effects over a longer term of administration.},

METHODS: Double blind, placebo-controlled, phase-III-study. 181 patients were screened. 165 patients with symmetrical, distal diabetic polyneuropathy were randomised to one of three treatment groups entering the wash-out phase and 133/124 patients were analysed in the ITT/PP analysis: Benfotiamine 600 mg per day (n=47/43), benfotiamine 300 mg per day (n=45/42) or placebo (n=41/39). RESULTS: After 6 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome parameter NSS (Neuropathy Symptom Score) differed significantly between the treatment groups (p=0.033) in the PP (per protocol) population. In the ITT (intention to treat) population, the improvement of NSS was slightly above significance (p=0.055). The TSS (Total Symptom Score) showed no significant differences after 6 weeks of treatment. The improvement was more pronounced at the higher benfotiamine dose and increased with treatment duration. In the TSS, best results were obtained for the symptom "pain". Treatment was well tolerated in all groups. CONCLUSION: Benfotiamine may extend the treatment option for patients with diabetic polyneuropathy based on causal influence on impaired glucose metabolism. Further studies should confirm the positive experiences.},

Physalis peruviana L., nombre científico de la uchuva, es la especie más conocida del género, originaria de los Andes, especialmente de Perú, Bolivia y Colombia donde crece como planta silvestre y semisilvestre en zonas entre 1.500 a 3.000 m.s.n.m. Se encuentra desde Venezuela hasta Chile, a todo lo largo y ancho de la cordillera andina, pero sólo en Colombia se cultiva con fines comerciales, donde posiblemente se inició el cultivo en la década de los años 80 y ha llevado al país a ser el primer productor mundial.},

  abstract = {We compared the value of using two in vivo solid tumor murine screening models, the B16 Melanoma and Colon 38 carcinoma, to the use of in vivo P388 leukemia in the detection of active extracts and in the prioritization of weak P388 active extracts. We found that, among a diverse group of 82 cytotoxc plant extracts negative in the P388 assay in vivo, only one had activity in B16 melanoma or Colon 38 and, among a group of 99 botanically diverse P388‐active extracts, none were active in either the B16 or Colon 38 models. We therefore conclude that the B16 and Colon 38 models in vivo are not useful for screening of crude extract and that, while the P388 leukemia may over‐predict useful leads due to its high sensitivity, its use as a first screen for crude extracts does not appear to result in missing solid tumor actives.

  abstract = {Chemical and pharmacological studies of Panax vietnamensis (Vietnamese ginseng; VG) have been reported since its discovery in 1973. However, the content of each saponin in different parts of VG has not been reported. In this study, 17 ginsenosides in the different underground parts of P. vietnamensis were analyzed by HPLC/evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Their contents in the dried rhizome, radix, and fine roots were 195, 156, and 139 mg/g, respectively, which were extremely high compared to other Panax species. The content of protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type saponins were not much different among underground parts; however, the content of protopanaxadiol (PPD)- and ocotillol (OCT)-type saponins were greatly different. It is noteworthy that the ginsenoside pattern in the fine roots is different from other underground parts. In particular, despite the content of PPD-type saponins being the highest in the fine roots, which is similar to other Panax species, the total content of saponins was the lowest in the fine roots, which is different from other Panax species. The ratios of PPT : PPD : OCT-type saponins were 1 : 1.7 : 7.8, 1 : 1.6 : 5.5, and 1 : 4.8 : 3.3 for the rhizome, radix, and fine roots, respectively. OCT-type saponins accounted for 36-75\% of total saponins and contributed mostly to the difference in the total saponin content of each part.},

  abstract = {The root of Panax notoginseng has been shown to change its saponin composition upon steaming. This study examines the effects of different steaming times and temperature on notoginseng root for saponin composition and anticancer activities. Steaming decreased the content of notoginsenoside R1, ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, R2, Rb3 and Rd, but increased the content of Rh1, Rg2, 20R-Rg2, Rg3 and Rh2. Steaming significantly influenced the transformation of Rg3. The amount of ginsenoside Rg3, an anticancer compound, was 5.23-fold greater in root steamed for 2 h at 120 °C than at 100 °C, and 3.22-fold greater when steamed for 4 h than for 1 h at 120 °C. For anticancer effects, the extract of steamed root significantly inhibited proliferation of SW-480 human colorectal cancer cells. The IC50of the steamed extract for 1, 2, 4 and 6 h at 120 °C was 259.2, 131.4, 123.7 and 127.1 μg/mL, respectively; the effect of unsteamed extract was low. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the apoptotic cell induction rates of SW-480 cells were 56.3\% and 64.4\% with 150.0 and 200.0 μg/mL extract steamed for 6 h. Compared with Rg1 and Rb1, only Rg3 had a significant antiproliferative effect. © 2009.},

  abstract = {Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been used as an adjunctive therapy for diabetic foot ulcers, although its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Recently, it has been shown that HBO mobilizes the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from bone marrow that eventually will aggregate in the wound. However, the gathering of the EPCs in diabetic wounds is impaired because of the decreased levels of local stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). Therefore, we investigated the influence of HBO on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a central regulator of SDF-1α and is down-regulated in diabetic wounds. The effects of HBO on HIF-1α function were studied in human dermal fibroblasts, SKRC7 cells, and HIF-1α knock-out and wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts using appropriate techniques (Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and luciferase hypoxia-responsive element reporter assay). Cellular proliferation was assessed using H(3) -thymidine incorporation assay. The effect of HIF in combination with HBOT was tested by inoculating stable HIF-1α-expressing adenovirus (Adv-HIF) into experimental wounds in db/db mice exposed to HBO. HBO activates HIF-1α at several levels by increasing both HIF-1α stability (by a non-canonical mechanism) and activity (as shown both by induction of relevant target genes and by a specific reporter assay). HIF-1α induction has important biological relevance because the induction of fibroblast proliferation in HBO disappears when HIF-1α is knocked down. Moreover, the local transfer of stable HIF-1α-expressing adenovirus (Adv-HIF) into experimental wounds in diabetic (db/db mice) animals has an additive effect on HBO-mediated improvements in wound healing. In conclusion, HBO stabilizes and activates HIF-1, which contributes to increased cellular proliferation. In diabetic animals, the local transfer of active HIF further improves the effects of HBO on wound healing.},

The effect of the substitution pattern of these PDS on their biological activities was investigated and structure-activity relationships were established. Among four PDS, the ranking of the haemolytic activity was K {$>$} R4{$>$} Rb1{$>$} Rd (P {$<$} 0.01 or {$<$}0.001). Rd, Rb1, and K could significantly enhance mitogen- and OVA-induced splenocyte proliferation in the OVA-immunized mice (P {$<$} 0.001), with the order in terms of stimulation index being Rd {$>$} Rb1{$>$} K {$>$} R4. OVA-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b antibody levels in the OVA-immunized mice were significantly enhanced by four PDS. Adjuvant potentials of Rd on antibody responses were higher than those of other three PDS. Meanwhile, Rd also significantly enhanced the production of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines in OVA-immunized mice (P {$<$} 0.05 or {$<$}0.01). The structure-activity relationship studies suggested that the length of sugar side chains at position C-20 and the linkage of glucose moiety at position C-3 of protopanaxadiol could affect the haemolytic and adjuvant activities of PDS. The information about this structure/function relationship might be useful for developing semisynthetic tetracyclic triterpenoid saponin derivatives with immunological adjuvant activity, as well as a reference to the distribution of the functional groups composing the saponin molecule. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction crystallography (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and NMR techniques were used to characterize the polysaccharide. Elemental analysis of the polysaccharide indicated that the contents of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen to be 27.31, 5.07 and 0.62 (w/w\%) respectively. SEM analysis suggested that the polysaccharide had irregular particle size, mostly seen as aggregates, and fibrous in nature. The samples had peaks at approximately 25, 32, 40 and 43 2θ degrees in the XRD pattern, which indicated both crystalline and amorphous structure. The major functional groups identified from FT-IR spectrum includes 1631.38 cm-1 (-COO-), 1377 cm-1 (-COO-) and 3193.93 cm-1 (-OH). Analytical data on MSP indicated that the major neutral sugars were α-d-glucose, β-d-glucose, rhamnose and d-Glucuronic acid.

  abstract = {Abstract             Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between biomolecules. Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data. The STRING resource is available online, at https://string-db.org/.},

  abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder is developed by exposure to a threatening and/or a horrifying event and characterized by the presence of anxiety, hyperarousal, avoidance, and sleep abnormality for a prolonged period of time. To elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms, we constructed a mouse model by electric foot shock followed by situational reminders and performed transcriptome analysis in brain tissues. The stressed mice acquired anxiety-like behavior after 2 weeks and exaggerated startle response after 4 weeks. Avoidance latency and freezing behavior were sustained up to 5 weeks post stress and abnormal static behavior was observed during the sleep period. RNA sequencing was performed in two of the emotional regulatory regions, anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, at 2 and 5 weeks post stress. More than 1000 differentially expressed genes were identified at 2 weeks in both regions. The number of the regulated genes remained constant in amygdala at 5 weeks post stress, whereas those in anterior cingulate cortex were plummeted. Although synaptic remodeling and endocrine system were the most enriched signaling pathways in both anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, the individual gene expression profile was regulated in a region- and time-dependent manner. In addition, several genes associated with PTSD involved in Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis were differentially regulated. These findings suggested that global gene expression profile was dynamically regulated in accordance with the disease development stage, and therefore targeting the distinct signaling molecules in different region and development stage might be critical for effective treatment to PTSD.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The Bacopa monnieri is traditional Ayurvedic medicine, and reported for memory-enhancing effects. The Bacoside is poorly soluble, bitter in taste and responsible for the memory enhancement action. Memory enhancer is commonly prescribed for children or elder people. Objective: Poor solubility, patient compliance and bitterness were a major driving force to develop taste masked β-cyclodextrin complex and dispersible tablets. Materials and Methods: The inclusion complex of Bacopa monnieri and β-cyclodextrin was prepared in different molar ratios of Bacopa monnieri by Co-precipitation method. Phase solubility study was conducted to evaluate the effect of β-cyclodextrin on aqueous solubility of Bacoside A. The characterization was determined by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction study (XRD).Crospovidone and croscarmallose sodium were used as super disintigrant.The 3 2 full factorial design was adopted to investigate the influence of two superdisintegrants on the wetting time and disntegration time of the tablets. Conclusion: The result revels that molar ratio (1:4) of inclusion complex enhance 3-fold solubility. Full factorial design was successfully employed for the optimization of dispersible tablet of B. monnieri. The short-term accelerated stability study confirmed that high stability of B. monnieri in inclusion complex.}

  abstract = {Isoflavones have been shown to exert antiproliferative effects on cancer cells by steroid receptor signaling. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of plant constituents extracted from Belamcanda chinensis as anticancer drugs, which regulate the aberrant expression of genes relevant in proliferation, invasion, immortalization and apoptosis. LNCaP cells were treated with B.chinensis extract, tectorigenin or other isoflavones and mRNA expression was quantified by using real time RT-PCR. In addition, ELISA, TRAP assays and western blots were used to measure protein expression or activity. Male nude mice (n = 18) were injected subcutaneously with LNCaP cells and were fed with extracts from B.chinensis, and tumor development was monitored versus a control animal group (n = 18). Tectorigenin and several other phytochemicals downregulated PDEF, PSA and IGF-1 receptor mRNA expression in vitro. Furthermore, PSA secretion and IGF-1 receptor protein expression were diminished, and hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity decreased after tectorigenin treatments. However, TIMP-3 mRNA was upregulated on tectorigenin treatment. Growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice was delayed and diminished in animals fed with extracts from B.chinensis. The downregulation of PDEF, PSA, hTERT and IGF-1 receptor gene expression by tectorigenin demonstrates the antiproliferative potential of these agents. The upregulation of TIMP-3 gene expression indicates a pro-apoptotic function of the drug and a reduction of the invasiveness of tumors. The animal experiments demonstrate that B.chinensis markedly inhibited the development of tumors in vivo. Thus, these compounds may be useful for the prevention or treatment of human prostate cancer. © Oxford University Press 2005; All rights reserved.},

L. cubeba EOs exhibits broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from 0.5 to 2500 µg/mL. This antimicrobial activity is attributed to the monoterpene citral, exhibiting a broad antimicrobial spectrum against bacteria and fungi (MICs 50–1000 µg/mL). Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found most resistant, with MIC values above 1000 µg/mL. Citral's mode of action is not fully investigated. At biocidal concentrations, it affects membrane structure and cell respiration, leading to rapid energy depletion and cell death. Involvement of intracellular reactive oxygen species has not been verified. Limonene exhibits insignificant antimicrobial activity. MICs of d-limonene range from 1 to 20 mg/mL. Citral and L. cubeba EOs were also subjects of food application studies. Promising results have been reported for fresh produce or fruit-juice.},

This study aims to investigate the effects of steaming on the chemical profile of P. notoginseng and the anti-proliferative effects of P. notoginseng on liver cancer cells. Methods: Samples of powdered raw P. notoginseng roots were steamed for various durations. Extracts of the raw and steamed samples were subjected to ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis for chemical profiling. The anti-proliferative effects on three human liver cancer cells, namely SNU449, SNU182 and HepG2, were evaluated using colorimetric WST-1 assay. Results: Steaming changed chromatographic and pharmacological profiles of P. notoginseng, causing differences in activities such as inhibition of cancer growth. Steamed P. notoginseng exhibited greater anti-proliferative effects against liver cancer cells (SNU449, SNU182 and HepG2) than its raw form; steaming up to 24 hours increased bioactivities. Steaming increased the concentrations of ginsenoside Rh2, Rk1, Rk3 and 20S-Rg3 and enhanced growth inhibition of liver cancer cells. Conclusion: Steaming changes the chemical profile as well as anti-cancer biological activities of P. notoginseng. Steamed P. notoginseng contains potential compounds for the treatment of liver cancer.},

In this study, we used Swiss Target Prediction database to predict the target of action, STRING database to build protein interaction network, and Cytoscape software to build \&quot;component-target-disease\&quot; network. The results showed that the antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects of Dictamni Cortex were closely related to the components of thymol methyl ether, elemenol, anethole, and the related targets of each component were cross-linked to play a multi-target pharmacodynamic role. This study laid a foundation for the study of the effective substance basis and quality control evaluation of the Dictamni Cortex, and provided a scientific basis for further revealing its mechanism.},

Forests have been extremely important in the country's economy and they will be essential in its future development. Forests contribute directly to the economy through the provision of building materials and energy and indirectly through foreign exchange earnings, which amount to about US\$200 million annually. Forests play a key role in the conservation of biodiversity. They protect watersheds and thus contribute to flood control and water management in the highly productive delta regions. In order for the forests to contribute to the national economy, strong forest management institutions and proper policies are necessary. Forest land use and exploitation should be strictly controlled, and effective programs must be developed. The potential of the forests can only be realized on a sustainable basis through significant changes in current practices.},

Here we have determined multiple bioactive components in SHXXT and investigated the comparative pharmacokinetics of rhein in rats. A sensitive and specific method combining liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry has been developed and validated to simultaneously quantify six active compounds in the pharmaceutical herbal product SHXXT to further study their pharmacokinetics in rats. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was employed for quantification with switching electrospray ion source polarity between positive and negative modes in a single run. There were no significant matrix effects in the quantitative analysis and the mean recovery for rhein in rat plasma was 91.6\%±3.4\%. The pharmacokinetic data of rhein demonstrate that the herbal formulae or the single herbal extract provide significantly higher absorption rate than the pure compound. This phenomenon suggests that the other herbal ingredients of SHXXT and rhubarb extract significantly enhance the absorption of rhein in rats. In conclusion, the herbal formulae (SHXXT) are more efficient than the single herb (rhubarb) or the pure compound (rhein) in rhein absorption.},

  abstract = {Situated in Southeast Asia, with a tropical monsoon climate, Vietnam is covered by tropical rain forests over one-quarter of its surface. Forests have been extremely important in the country's economy and they will be essential in its future development. Forests contribute directly to the economy through the provision of building materials and energy and indirectly through foreign exchange earnings, which amount to about US\$200 million annually. Forests play a key role in the conservation of biodiversity. They protect watersheds and thus contribute to flood control and water management in the highly productive delta regions. In order for the forests to contribute to the national economy, strong forest management institutions and proper policies are necessary. Forest land use and exploitation should be strictly controlled, and effective programs must be developed. The potential of the forests can only be realized on a sustainable basis through significant changes in current practices.},

These sesquiterpenoids did not exert significant agonistic effect but antagonized the activity of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an endogenous FXR agonist, for FXR driven SHP promoter transactivation. Additionally, they transactivated CYP7A1 gene promoter activity by antagonizing FXR. Apart from acting as a FXR antagonist, atractylenolide III also showed agonistic activity against PR. All these results demonstrated that atractylenolide II and III are the active components of Atractylodes macrocephala to exert specific pharmacologic effects.},

Objectives: This study reports the synthesis of a novel biocompatible non-phospholipid human metabolite "Creatinine" based niosomal delivery system for Azithromycin improved oral bioavailability. Methods: Synthesized surfactant was characterized through spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques and then the potential for niosomal vesicle formation was evaluated using Azithromycin as model drug. Drug loaded vesicles were characterized for size, polydispersity index (PDI), shape, drug encapsulation efficiency (EE), in vitro release and drug–excipient interaction using zetasizer, atomic force microscope (AFM), LC–MS/MS and FTIR. The biocompatibility of surfactant was investigated through cells cytotoxicity, blood hemolysis and acute toxicity. Azithromycin encapsulated in niosomes was investigated for in vivo bioavailability in rabbits. Results: The vesicles were spherical with 247\,±\,4.67\,nm diameter hosting 73.29\,±\,3.51\% of the drug. Surfactant was nontoxic against cell cultures and caused 5.80\,±\,0.51\% hemolysis at 1000\,µg/mL. It was also found safe in mice up to 2.5\,g/kg body weight. Synthesized surfactant based niosomal vesicles revealed enhanced oral bioavailability of Azithromycin in rabbits. Conclusions: The results of the present study confirm that the novel surfactant is highly biocompatible and the niosomal vesicles can be efficiently used for improving the oral bioavailability of poor water soluble drugs.},

Chen (Araliaceae) known as Tianqi or san qi is a well-known medicinal herb in Asia for its long history of use in Chinese medicine. Qualified as 'the miracle root for the preservation of life', it has been used in China for 600 years, for treatment of various diseases. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are the key active components. PNS have been widely used in China for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, scientific studies have shown a wide range of other pharmacological applications including anti-cancer, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents, immunologic adjuvant and prevention of diabetes complications. Recently, hypoglycemic and anti-obesity properties of PNS have also been demonstrated. The present review highlights the effects of PNS on glucose production and absorption, and on inflammatory processes that seem to play an important role in the development of diabetes.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO\{radical dot\}) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain "redox balance" termed also "redox homeostasis". The "two-faced" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular "redox homeostasis"; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Dendritic lithium growth is known to result in short circuits upon cycling. Before considering ways to master lithium deposits morphologies, we have embarked on a study aimed at characterizing by mean of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): (1) the texture of metallic lithium (2) the influence of cycling parameters, such as current densities and liquid electrolyte formulation, on lithium stripping mechanisms and (3) the lithium deposits morphologies on various lithium surface states (in and ex situ prepared through electrochemical means, physical procedures such as polishing and Pulsed Laser Deposition technique). Different lithium stripping processes have been revealed depending on current densities. They lead to various surface defects from which lithium dendrites will preferentially grow upon following Li plating. Furthermore, cycling experiments have highlighted, for the first time, the internal lithium micro-texture. Pursuing this study, we finally shed light on the crucial role of the electrolytic mix formulation and cell pressure on lithium cycling efficiency.},

The parameters linearity, precision , accuracy, and standard error were studies according to indian herbal pharmacopiea. In this present study a new, simple, rapid, sensitive, precise and economic spectrophotometric method in ultraviolet region has been developed for the determination of piperine in market and laboratory herbal formulation of Sitopaladi churna. which were procured and purchased respectively from the local market and they were evaluated as per Indian herbal Pharmacopoeia and WHO guidelines. The concentration of piperine present in raw material of PSC was found to be 1.45±0.014 w/w in piper longum fruits. Piperine has the maximum wavelength at 342.5 nm and hence the UV spectrophotometric method was performed at 342.5 nm. The samples were prepared in methanol and methos obeys Beers law in concentration ranges employed for evaluation. The content of piperine in ayurvedic formulation was determined. The result of analysis have been validated statistically and recovery studies confirmed the accuracy of the proposed method. Hence the proposed method can be used for the reliable quantification of Piperine in crude drug and its herbal formulation.},

There is a great variability in the chemical composition of EOs obtained from the five Egyptian aromatic plants. Thyme EO had the highest content of total phenols (913.17 mg GAE/L). Black cumin (highest \% of inhibition of DPPH radical: 95.89\% and highest FRAC values 3.33 mmol/L Trolox) and thyme (highest \% of inhibition of TBARS: 80.76) essential oils presented the best antioxidant profile.

In May 2004, US Food and Drug Administration published a report on the occurrence of parent furan in a number of thermally treated foods. Since furan has been classified as "possibly carcinogenic to human" by IARC, a great concern has been addressed to the analysis of this substance naturally-occurring in food. This paper gives a short overview on the mechanistic pathways of the parent furan formation in food by degradation of amino acids and/or reducing sugars, and oxidation of ascorbic acid and poly-unsaturated acids which can be induced by thermal or irradiation treatments; further, it deals with the metabolism and toxicology of furan as well as with the comparison of the methods of furan determination.},

  abstract = {The chemical characteristics for different parts of Panax notoginseng, including root, fibre root, rhizome, stem, leaf, flower and seed, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE). Eight major saponins, namely notoginsenoside R1, ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, Rb2, Rb3 and Rd were also quantitatively compared among the different parts of P. notoginseng. The chromatograms showed that there was significant difference between underground (root, fibre root, rhizome) and aerial (leaf and flower) parts from P. notoginseng, though the similarities of entire chromatographic patterns among tested samples from underground (0.965 ± 0.029, n = 12) and aerial parts (0.987 ± 0.014, n = 5) were similar, respectively. Especially, no saponin was detected in the seed of P. notoginseng. Hierarchical clustering analysis based on eight investigated saponins or the ratios of contents for ginsenoside Rg1/Rb1 and ginsenoside Rb3/Rb1 showed that the samples from different parts of P. notoginseng were divided into three main clusters. One cluster was underground parts, which contained rich protopanaxatriol and protopanaxadiol types saponins. The leaf and flower were in the same cluster, which contained protopanaxadiol type saponins only. Especially, ginsenoside Rc, Rb2 and Rb3, rare in the underground parts, were rich in aerial parts of P. notoginseng. The stem of P. notoginseng was another cluster. Based on the cluster analysis, the chemical characteristics for different parts of P. notoginseng were revealed. They are composite cluster (underground parts), protopanaxadiol cluster (aerial parts) and interim (stem) cluster, which was the one between the two typical clusters, respectively. The result shows that chemical characteristics of underground parts and aerial parts from P. notoginseng are obviously different, which is helpful for pharmacological evaluation and quality control of P. notoginseng. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here, an arabinogalactan polysaccharide, RN1 was isolated from flowers of Panax notoginseng. Its structure was determined to possess a backbone of 1,6-linked Galp branched at C3 by side 1,3-linked Galp, with branches attached at position O-3 of it. The branches mainly contained 1,5-linked, 1,3,5-linked, terminal Arabinose and terminal Galactose. RN1 could inhibit microvessel formation in the BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell xenograft tumor in nude mice. The antiangiogenesis assay showed that RN1 could reduce the migratory activity of endothelial cells and their ability of tube formation on matrigel, but no effect on endothelial cells growth. Further studies revealed that RN1 could inhibit BMP2/Smad1/5/8/Id1 signaling. All those data indicated the RN1 had an antiangiogenic effect via BMP2 signaling and could be a potential novel inhibitor of angiogenesis.},

We used high performance liquid chromatography to determine the contents of major saponins in NGRE. The anti-proliferative effects were evaluated by the cell counting method, and concentration-related anti-proliferative effects were observed. At 1.0 mg/ml, NGRE inhibited cell growth by 85.8\% (P{$<$}0.01), probably linked to the higher concentration of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1. The pharmacologic activities of notoginsenoside R1 and ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 on the cells were antiproliferative. We tested the effects of NGRE on DNA synthesis by measuring [3H]-thymidine incorporation. NGRE induced cell apoptosis at 0.5 and 1 mg/ml. Two-day treatment with 300 microM of notoginsenoside R1, ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 increased cell apoptosis significantly. Cell cycle and cyclin A assay showed that NGRE arrested cells in the synthesis phase and increased the expression of cyclin A remarkably. NGRE also enhanced the actions of two chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan. Cell growth decreased more with the combined treatment of NGRE and 5-fluorouracil (or irinotecan) than with the chemotherapy agent applied alone, suggesting that notoginseng can reduce the dose of 5-fluorouracil (or irinotecan) needed to achieve desired effects. Further in vivo and human trials are warranted to test whether notoginseng is a valuable chemo-adjuvant with clinical validity.},

(Asparagaceae) yields Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, which has a long history to be used as a traditional medicine to treat various ailments, like cold-induced febrile disease with arthralgia, hematochezia, tidal fever and night sweats by Yin deficiency, bone-steaming, cough, and hemoptysis. It is also used as an ingredient of healthy food, wine, tea, biological toothpaste. Its importance is demonstrated by large scale to treat kinds of diseases in eastern Asian countries. The aim of this review is to provide up-to-date information about phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Anemarrhena asphodeloides based on scientific literatures. It will build up a new foundation for further study on mechanism and development of better therapeutic agent and healthy product from Anemarrhena asphodeloides. Material and methods All the available information on Anemarrhena asphodeloides was collected via electronic search (using PubMed, SciFinder Scholar, CNKI, TPL (www.theplantlist.org), Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, and Web of Science). Results Comprehensive analysis of the literatures searched through sources available above confirmed that the ethnomedical uses of Anemarrhena asphodeloides had been recorded in China, Japan, and Korea for thousands of years. The phytochemical investigation revealed the presence of steroidal saponins, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, steroids, organic acids, anthraquinones, and others. Crude extracts and pure compounds from Anemarrhena asphodeloides exhibited significant pharmacological effects on the nervous system and the blood system. They also showed valuable bioactivities, such as antitumor, anti-oxidation, anti-microbial, anti-virus, anti-inflammation, anti-osteoporosis, anti-skin aging and damage as well as other activities. Conclusions In light of long traditional use and modern phytochemical and pharmacological studies summarized, Anemarrhena asphodeloides has demonstrated a strong potential for therapeutic and health-maintaining purposes. Both the extracts and chemical components isolated from the plant showed a wide range of biological activities. Thus more pharmacological mechanisms on main active compounds (TBII, TAIII, mangiferin and other ingredients) are necessary to be explored. In addition, as a good source of the traditional medicine, clinical studies of main therapeutic aspects (e.g. diabetes, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, etc.), toxicity and adverse effect of Anemarrhena asphodeloides will also undoubtedly be the focus of future investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) consist of major therapeutically active components of Panax notoginseng. PNS inhibit the growth of a variety of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of PNS on breast cancer metastasis. Materials and methods 4T1 cell, a highly metastatic mouse breast carcinoma cell line, was utilized for in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro assays were first performed to examine the effects of PNS on 4T1 cell viability, migration and invasion, respectively. Real-time PCR analyses were also performed to examine the effects of PNS on the expression of genes associated with tumor metastasis. The effect of PNS on 4T1 tumor cell metastasis was further assessed in spontaneous and experimental metastasis models in vivo. Results PNS treatment exhibited a dose-dependent effect on impairing 4T1 cell viability in vitro. However, when examined at a lower dose that did not affect cell viability, the migration and invasion of 4T1 cell was remarkably inhibited in vitro. Meanwhile, PNS treatment led to upregulated expression of genes known to inhibit metastasis and downregulated expression of genes promoting metastasis in cultured 4T1 cells. These results suggested a selective effect of PNS on 4T1 migration and invasion. This hypothesis was further addressed in 4T1 metastasis models in vivo. The results showed that the lung metastasis was significantly inhibited by PNS treatment in both spontaneous and experimental metastasis models. Conclusion Taken together, our results demonstrated an inhibitory effect of PNS on 4T1 tumor metastasis, warranting further evaluation of PNS as a therapeutic agent for treating breast cancer metastasis. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The root of this plant, called notoginseng or sanchi, has a long history of use as a remedy in Oriental traditional medicine. Modern studies have found that extracts and compounds from notoginseng exert various physiological effects. The active constituents are mainly recognized as saponins. In this review, we summarized the discovery and analysis of chemical constituents in notoginseng. Fifty-six saponins from notoginseng were isolated and elucidated. All of them are dammarane saponins, 35 of which can be classified as belonging to the protopanaxadiols group, and 21 as belonging to the protopanaxatriols group. Evidence from phytochemical studies on notoginseng demonstrated that no oleanane-type saponin, which exists in Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), was found. Other types of compounds such as nonprotein amino acids, polyacetylenes, phytosterols, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, many of which have pharmacological activities, were also isolated from notoginseng. Analytical studies on notoginseng were carried out based on botanical and phytochemical advances. In the qualitative studies, identification of the herbal materials and extracts was the main objective. The utilization of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint and molecular biological methods made the identification accurate and efficient. Spectral, chromatographic and immunoassay methods were used for the quantitative analysis. HPLC methods are the main authority regarding the determination of saponins and other types of constituents. The chromatographic conditions and detectors employed in the HPLC are discussed.},

Since microglia-mediated inflammation is critical for induction of neurodegeneration, this study was designed to investigate the effect of PF11 on activated microglia. PF11 significantly suppressed the release of ROS and proinflammatory mediators induced by LPS in a microglial cell line N9 including NO, PGE2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Moreover, PF11 inhibited interaction and expression of TLR4 and MyD88 in LPS-activated N9 cells, resulting in an inhibition of the TAK1/IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. PF11 also inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKs induced by LPS in N9 cells. Importantly, PF11 significantly alleviated the death of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons induced by the conditioned-medium from activated microglia. At last, the effect of PF11 on neuroinflammation was confirmed in vivo: PF11 mitigated the microglial activation and proinflammatory factors expression obviously in both cortex and hippocampus in mice injected intrahippocampally with LPS. These findings indicate that PF11 exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects on LPS-activated microglial cells by inhibiting TLR4-mediated TAK1/IKK/NF-κB, MAPKs and Akt signaling pathways, suggesting its therapeutic implication for neurodegenerative disease associated with neuroinflammation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This inhibitor exhibited strong anti-α-glucosidase activity with an IC50 value of 170.62 nM and stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the uptake of a fluorescent d-glucose analog, 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2- deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG), in HepG2 cells at a rate higher than that of insulin controls. It was also found to be associated with adipocyte differentiation and moderate increases in 2-NBDG uptake by 3T3-L1 cells.

The AIR was rich in carbohydrates (942 mg g-1), notably cellulosic glucose, and was poorly lignified (6 mg g-1). Approximately 4 and 6\% of the AIR could be sequentially extracted using CDTA and HCl (CSP and HSP respectively). After such depectination treatments, 4, 6 and 4\% of the AIR were extracted by increasing concentrations of KOH (0·05 m (OHSP-I), 1 m (1OH-I) \& 4 m (4OH-I), respectively). By contrast, alkali treatments alone (KOH 0·05 m (OHSP-II), 1 m (1OH-II) \& 4 m (4OH-II)) extracted 2, 4 and 5\% of the AIR, respectively. Hemicelluloses extracted by 1 m and 4 m KOH in both series were further fractionated through precipitation, upon neutralization of the extracts. Precipitates accounted for 82, 60, 74 and 60\% of total hemicelluloses in the 1OH-I, 4OH-I, 1OH-II \& 4OH-II extracts respectively, and appreared to be essentially pure, acidic xylans. More variation was seen in the composition of the soluble polymers, which were rich in xylose, glucose and uronic acids. Extracts were fractionated on Sephacryl S500 and DEAE Sepharose CL-6B. In the 'pectic' fractions, high molecular weight arabinans were found in HSP as well as xylose-rich polymers. Concentrated alkalis extracted small amounts of low molecular weight pectic material, but only after prior depectination had been carried out. The final residue accounted for around 61\% of the AIR after depectination and alkali treatment, and contained 91\% cellulose; after alkali treatment alone, it accounted for about 84\% of the AIR and was rich in glucose (∼70\%) and uronic acids (∼16\%). © 1994.},

On purpose of comprehensive utilization we have furnished reliable reports of che、mical studies of its rootlets, stems, leaves and fruit stalks which have not been used in medical practice and suggested to use them as raw materials for preparation of pharmaceuticals and saponins. A newer, simpler and easier method for extraction and isolation of saponins have also been carried out. This method leads to prepare standard ginsenoside-Rg\_1 and-Rb\_1 from Sanchi which are furnished as standards in qulitative control of Panax ginseng and P. notoginseng and their preparations. Some pharmacological activities of Sanchi have also been studied, such as the effects of saponins from Sanchion cardiovascular system; cerebrovaseular system; central nervious system; blood and homopoietic system; protection against shock; metabolism; experimental Liver injury and anti-inflammatory activity etc. In according with those studies some new drugs for treatment of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases and a new drug for treatment of hemicrania and hypnotic effect has been developed.

It has long been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of traumatic injury, rheumatic arthralgia, nephritis, edema, hepatitis and diabetes mellitus in China. Aim of study To evaluate the antihyperglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities of total saponins extracted from Aralia taibaiensis (SAT) in experimental type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) rats. Materials and methods Acute toxicity was studied in rats to determine the safe oral dose of SAT. Then, SAT was given orally to normal and streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced T2DM rats at 80, 160 and 320 mg/kg doses for a series of 28 days to determine the antihyperglycemic activity. Glibenclamide (600 μg/kg), a standard antidiabetic drug, was used as a positive control drug. At the end of treatment, biochemical parameters and antioxidant levels were measured to evaluate the hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities of SAT. Results Oral administration of SAT did not exhibit toxicity and death at a dose not more than 2000 mg/kg. SAT dose-dependently improved the symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weight loss in diabetic rats. Compared with diabetic control group, administration of 320 mg/kg SAT resulted in significant (P{$<$}0.05) fall in the levels of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, creatinine, urea, alanine transarninase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and malondialdehyde, but significant (P{$<$}0.05) increase in the levels of serum insulin, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione. However, SAT did not have any effect on the normal rats. Conclusions SAT had excellent antihyperglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities in T2DM rats and might be a promising drug in the therapy of diabetes mellitus and its complications. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) has important antioxidant and metabolic functions in both plants and animals, but humans, and a few other animal species, have lost the capacity to synthesize it. Plant-derived ascorbate is thus the major source of vitamin C in the human diet. Although the biosynthetic pathway of L-ascorbic acid in animals is well understood, the plant pathway has remained unknown-one of the few primary plant metabolic pathways for which this is the case. L-ascorbate is abundant in plants (found at concentrations of 1-5 mM in leaves and 25 mM in chloroplasts) and may have roles in photosynthesis and transmembrane electron transport. We found that D-mannose and L-galactose are efficient precursors for ascorbate synthesis and are interconverted by GDP-D-mannose-3,5-epimerase. We have identified an enzyme in pea and Arabidopsis thaliana, L-galactose dehydrogenase, that catalyses oxidation of L-galactose to L-galactono-1,4-lactone. We propose an ascorbate biosynthesis pathway involving GDP-D-mannose, GDP-L-galactose, L-galactose and L-galactono-1,4-lactone, and have synthesized ascorbate from GDP-D-mannose by way of these intermediates in vitro. The definition of this biosynthetic pathway should allow engineering of plants for increased ascorbate production, thus increasing their nutritional value and stress tolerance.},

Setting. Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut; animals were housed at the Hartford Hospital animal facility. Animals. Sixty-two male Wistar rats. Intervention. Administration of placebo (wheat flour), and alcohol, hydrophilic (water), and lipophilic (hexane) extracts of notoginseng. Methods. Rats were divided into five groups, and their tails were transected 5 mm from the tip. Group 1 received no treatment (control), group 2 received placebo, group 3 received alcohol extract, group 4 received hydrophilic extract, and group 5 received lipophilic extract. Total bleeding time was determined and compared among the groups. Main Results. Bleeding time was shorter for the placebo group than the control group (p=0.035). The alcohol extract group had the shortest bleeding time, which was significantly shorter than that of the control (p{$<$}0.0001), placebo (p=0.0124), and lipophilic extract groups (p=0.002). The hydrophilic extract group had a shorter bleeding time than the control group (p=0.0058) and showed a trend toward shorter bleeding time than the lipophilic extract group (p=0.068). Conclusions. The alcohol extract of notoginseng results in the shortest bleeding time and provides better hemostatic effects than no treatment, placebo treatment, and treatment with lipophilic extract.}

The number of cases of dementia are estimated to almost triple by 2050. Dementia is overwhelming not only for the people who have it, but also for their caregivers and families. There is a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia in most countries, resulting in stigmatization, barriers to diagnosis and care, and impacting carers, families and societies physically, psychologically and economically.},

Protein exposed to glucose undergoes fragmentational and conformational alterations, and these, as well as thiol oxidation, appear to be caused by hydroxyl radicals. Glycofluorophore formation is dependent upon ketoaldehyde formation. It is suggested that glucose autoxidation contributes to oxidative stress in pathophysiology associated with diabetes and ageing via this newly described process of "autoxidative glycosylation".}

The ginsenoside Rh4 (Rh4), a rare saponin obtained from Panax notoginseng, dissolves in water more readily than total saponins, making this compound easier to use in anti-cancer pharmaceutics. Here, we investigated the antiproliferative activity and mechanisms of Rh4 in colorectal cancer, both in vivo and in vitro. A colorectal cancer xenograft model showed that Rh4 significantly inhibited tumor growth with few side effects. CCK-8 assays, flow cytometric analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that Rh4 effectively suppressed colorectal cancer cell proliferation via inducing G0/G1phase arrest, caspase-dependent apoptosis and autophagic cell death but was not significantly cytotoxic to normal colon epithelial cells. Furthermore, apoptosis played a dominant role in Rh4-induced cell death, as the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocked cell death to a greater extent than the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Moreover, Rh4 increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and subsequently activated the JNK-p53 pathway. An ROS scavenger and JNK and p53 inhibitors significantly attenuated Rh4-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Thus, the present study is the first to illustrate that Rh4 triggers apoptosis and autophagy via activating the ROS/JNK/p53 pathway in colorectal cancer cells, providing basic scientific evidence that Rh4 shows great potential as an anti-cancer agent.},

However, the pharmacology and molecular mechanism of HHS on ulcerative colitis still unclear. Purpose Implement network pharmacology and molecular docking for revealing main active components of Huaihuasan against ulcerative colitis and to explore therapeutic mechanism. Study design and methods TCMSP, PubChem, Swiss Target Prediction and GeneCards are utilized to search the active components and effective targets of HHS and ulcerative colitis. The co-targets between HHS and ulcerative colitis are obtained by Draw Venn Diagram. STRING database is intended to draw the PPI network. To obtain the core targets, topological analysis is used by Cytoscape 3.7.2. GO and KEGG enrichment pathway analysis was performed to Metascape platform, and molecular docking through Autodock Vina 1.1.2 finished. Result 21 active components with 211 effective targets of HHS, and 2325 effective targets of ulcerative colitis were screened. The Venn analysis was contained 89 co-targets. Enrichment analysis showed that HHS played a role in pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, etc. Finally, two targets (AKT1 and EGFR) were successfully docked with 3 core components (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin), respectively. Conclusion HHS can act on multiple targets through multi-pathway, so as to perform its therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis.},

Additionally, 1 exhibited high scavenging activity against DPPH free radicals with a 50\% scavenging concentration (SC50) of 11.72 +/- 0.91 microg/mL, suggesting that this arabinoglucogalactan is a potential antiradical.}

  abstract = {Sanchi, also known as Radix Notoginseng, is a Chinese traditional medicine prepared from roots of the herb Panax notoginseng. Sanchi is traditionally used as a hemostatic to control internal and external bleeding but also shows diverse bioactivities that include increasing coronary blood flow and reducing myocardial oxygen consumption and blood pressure. Although research into the potential cardioprotective effects of Sanchi is ongoing in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, we sought to explore potential benefits in cardiovascular disorders associated with excess cholesterol and hyperlipidemia. We have investigated the effects of Sanchi as a dietary supplement on hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on a high-fat diet. Diets were supplemented with Sanchi at 0.25\%, 0.5\% and 1\% (w/w) for four weeks, while control animals received no supplement. Sanchi administration to hyperlipidemic rats resulted in a significant decline in serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein- cholesterol, with an increase in serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Treated animals also showed reduced levels of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase. Furthermore, Sanchi improved hepatic antioxidant status as assessed by superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and reduced levels of lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that Sanchi consumption can improve lipid profiles, inhibit peroxidation, and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and is thereby likely to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease associated with hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The present study evaluated the potential antidepressant activity of SCLPN in rodent models of depression and the mechanism of action of SCLPN. Mice were received SCLPN at doses of 10-1000 mg/kg daily for 1, 7, and 14 days and then were subjected to the forced swim test and locomotor activity test. The results showed that SCLPN decreased immobility time in the forced swim test, with little effect on locomotion. In the chronic mild stress model, chronic SCLPN treatment (70 mg/kg) reversed the rats' depression-like behavior. Furthermore, SCLPN exerted its antidepressant-like effect by increasing the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Additionally, SCLPN treatment reduced intracellular Ca2+in cultured neurons. The present study suggests that SCLPN may function as an antidepressant, and the antidepressant-like effects of SCLPN may be mediated by modulation of brain monoamine neurotransmitters and intracellular Ca2+concentration. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The antioxidant activities of these extracts were evaluated by studying the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes induced by ascorbate/Fe2+, cumine hydroperoxide (CHP) or CCl4/reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The antioxidant capacities were also evaluated by studying the scavenging of 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. The antiglycation activities of these extracts were evaluated by hemoglobin-δ-gluconolactone (δ-Glu) assay, bovine serum albumin (BSA)-glucose assay and N-acetyl-glycyl-lysine methyl ester (GK peptide)-ribose assay. Aralia taibaiensis outperformed other extracts in most of the assays except inhibition of early glycation products formation, where Acanthopanax senticosus showed higher activity. Aralia taibaiensis was particularly potent in inhibiting the late glycation and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on proteins. The antioxidant and antiglycation activities of most extracts were correlated with the saponin content. The results demonstrate that the antidiabetic activities of most extracts could be explained, at least in part, by their combined antioxidant and antiglycation properties.

Dose-related effects of ginsenoside Re on fasting blood glucose levels were observed. After the 20 mg/kg treatment, fasting blood glucose levels were reduced to 188±9.2 and 180±10.8 mg/dl on Day 5 and Day 12, respectively (both P{$<$}0.01 compared to vehicle group, 229±9.5 and 235±13.4 mg/dl, respectively). The EC70of ginsenoside Re was calculated to be 10.3 mg/kg and was used for subsequent studies. Consistent with the reduction in blood glucose, there were significant decreases in both fed and fasting serum insulin levels in mice treated with ginsenoside Re. With 12 days of ginsenoside treatment, glucose tolerance of ob/ob mice increased significantly, and the area under the curve for glucose decreased by 17.8\% (P{$<$}0.05 compared to vehicle treatment). The hypoglycemic effect of the ginsenoside persisted even at 3 days of treatment cessation (blood glucose levels: 198±13.1 with ginsenoside treatment vs. 253±20.3 mg/dl with vehicle, P{$<$}0.01). There were no significant changes in body weight or body temperature. Preliminary microarray analysis revealed differential expression of skeletal muscle genes associated with lipid metabolism and muscle function.

  abstract = {The medicinal herb, Panax notoginseng, has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine and possesses anti-fibrosis properties. Epithelial-myofibroblast transition (EMT) plays an important role in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The present study was designed to examine whether ginsenoside Rg1, a major active component isolated from Panax notoginseng, has an ability to block this phenotypic transition in rat renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). The morphology of tubular epithelial-myofibroblast transition was observed through light microscope and transmission electron microscopy. α-SMA and E-cadherin are two markers of tubular epithelial-myofibroblast transition, their protein expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Gene expression of α-SMA as well as the two major extracellular matrix components collagen I and fibronectin was measured by real-time PCR analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitatively detect collagen I and fibronectin in the supernatant. Our results revealed that ginsenoside Rg1 obviously blocked morphologic transformation in NRK-52E induced by TGF-β1. Meanwhile, ginsenoside Rg1 inhibited the expression of α-SMA and the loss of E-cadherin, subsequently decreased the levels of collagen I and fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, western blot analysis indicated that ginsenoside Rg1 inhibited the expression of P-ERK1/2 in NRK-52E induced by TGF-β1. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 can restrain the process of EMT maybe via suppressing the expression of P-ERK1/2 in vitro. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Chen, as traditional Chinese medicine, has a long history of high clinical value, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, regulation of blood glucose and blood pressure, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, and neuronal protection, and its main ingredients are Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). Currently, Panax notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen may improve mental function, have anti-insomnia and anti-depression effects, alleviate anxiety, and decrease neural network excitation. However, the underlying effects and the mechanisms of Panax notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen and its containing chemical constituents (PNS) on these depression-related or anxiety-related diseases has not been completely established. This review summarized the antidepressant or anxiolytic effects and mechanisms of PNS and analyzed network targets of antidepressant or anxiolytic actions with network pharmacology tools to provide directions and references for further pharmacological studies and new ideas for clinical treatment of nervous system diseases and drug studies and development. The review showed PNS and its components may exert these effects through regulating neurotransmitter mechanism (5-HT, DA, NE), modulation of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, glutamatergic system, hypo-thalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its intracellular signaling pathways in the central nervous system; and produce neuronal protection by anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, or inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, or platelet aggregation and its intracellular signaling pathways. Network target analysis indicated PNS and its components also may have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, which leads to the preservation of brain nerves, and regulate the activity and secretion of nerve cells, exerting anti-depression and anxiolytic effects, which may provide new directions for further in-depth researches of related mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Soybean soluble polysaccharides (SSPS) were extracted under acidic condition from the okara of producing soybean protein isolate. The methyl esterificated carboxylic group of galacturonic acid (GalA) in SSPS could be demethoxylated by alkali treatment when heated, which had effects on SSPS properties. In this study, okara was treated in six selected alkali conditions, and then SSPS were extracted under the acidic condition (115 °C, 100 min, pH 4.5). The obtained SSPS were determined to have degree of esterification (DE) of 49, 55, 60, 66, 74 and 83\%, respectively. Violent alkali treatment produced SSPS with not only lower DE but also lower molecular weight (MW) compared to mild alkali treatment. MW was increased from 396 to 489 kDa with increasing DE. It was found that SSPS with lower DE possessed lower aqueous viscosity, more negative charges, better emulsifying activity in oil-in-water emulsion and stabilizing activity in acidic milk drink. When DE changed from 49 to 83\%, aqueous viscosity (10\% (w/w) SSPS), average particle size of fresh oil-in-water emulsion, and centrifugation precipitating rate (CPR) of acidic milk drink (pH 4.5; two-stage 30 MPa homogeneous pressure) were increased from 25.8 to 108.2 mPa s, 1.5 to 4.0 μm, and 0.20 to 0.47\%, respectively; and zeta potential (pH 7) was decreased from 17 to 10 mV. These results suggested that SSPS obtained from different alkali treatment had different functional properties.},

Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathogen, may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. Here, we studied the effects of TSA on atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice with P. gingivalis infection. Eight-week-old ApoE-/- mice were randomized to (a) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (b) P. gingivalis, and (c) P. gingivalis + TSA (60~mg~kg-1~day-1). The mice were injected with (a) PBS, or (b) and (c) P. gingivalis 3 times per week for a total of 10 times. After 8~weeks, atherosclerotic risk factors in serum and in heart, aorta, and liver tissues were analyzed in all mice using Oil Red O, atherosclerosis cytokine antibody arrays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time PCR, and microRNA array. CD40, G-CSF, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-3α, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and VEGF were attenuated by TSA in atherosclerosis cytokine antibody arrays. TSA-treated mice showed a significant reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP), ox-LDL, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α in ELISA data. Real-time PCR analyses showed that TSA decreased the expression of CCL-2, CD40, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MMP-2 in heart and aorta tissues. Moreover, hepatic CRP was downregulated by TSA, although FASN and HMG-CoA were not. The relative expressions of miR-146b and miR-155 were elevated by P. gingivalis infection and were downregulated by TSA treatment. These results suggest that TSA was a potential therapeutic agent that may have the ability to prevent P. gingivalis-induced atherosclerosis associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.},

The curcumin loading efficiency of the emulsion was 99.9\% and diameter of the droplets was about 324 nm. Only 3\% of the loaded curcumin degraded when the emulsion was stored at 4 °C for 40 days. About 73\% of the curcumin was released after 2 h digestion of the emulsion in simulated gastric fluid followed by 2 h digestion in simulated intestinal fluid. The curcumin pharmacokinetics in mice was analyzed after oral administration. The curcumin absorption of the emulsion treatment group was more rapid and effective than the absorption of curcumin/Tween 20 suspension treatment group. The curcumin oral bioavailability of the emulsion group was 11-fold higher than the bioavailability of curcumin/Tween 20 suspension group.

Under anesthesia, the values of heart rate (HR) , mean arterial pressure (MAP) , left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) , maximal rate for left ventricular pressure rising and declining ( ±dp/dt max ) were monitored using Biopac systems MP150. Results: Significant alterations of parameters were observed when animals were administrated with more than 150 mg kg -1 of PNS 10 min after treatment. Moreover, 450 mg kg -1 of PNS caused animal death. Conclusion: PNS at larger doses ( ≥150 mg kg -1 ) possesses the potential of cardiac toxicity; however the accumulative effect of PNS is not obvious.},

Lifestyle factors and ethnicity are two determinants in the etiology of T2DM, and lifestyle changes such as higher fat intake and less physical activity link readily to T2DM in East Asians. It is widely recognized that T2DM in East Asians is characterized primarily by β cell dysfunction, which is evident immediately after ingestion of glucose or meal, and less adiposity compared to the disease in Caucasians. These pathophysiological differences have an important impact on therapeutic approaches. Here, we revisit the pathogenesis of T2DM in light of β cell dysfunction versus insulin resistance in East Asians and discuss ethnic differences in the contributions of insulin secretion and insulin resistance, together with incretin secretin and action, to glucose intolerance.},

Materials and methods: KK-Ay mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of PNS 200. mg/kg or vehicle for 30 days while ginsenoside Re 14. mg/kg, Rd 15. mg/kg, Rg1 40. mg/kg, Rb1 60. mg/kg and notoginsenoside R1 6. mg/kg for 12 days. Fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL), glucose tolerance (GT), serum insulin, leptin levels, body weight changes, food intake, adipose tissues and blood fat levels were measured at different time points. Results: The PNS group had significantly lower FBGL, improved GT and smaller body weight incremental percentage after the 30-day treatment. Additionally, Rb1 exhibited significant reduction of FBGL on day 12, and Re also exhibited a decreasing trend after the 12-day treatment. Conclusions: PNS possess anti-hyperglycemic and anti-obese activities by improving insulin- and leptin sensitivity, and Rb1 is responsible for the anti-hyperglycemic effect among the five saponins in KK-Ay mice. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The drug-treated cells displayed features of apoptosis, including typical morphological characteristics and formation of DNA ladders, as evident from agarose-gel electrophoresis. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that the cell-cycle distribution of HeLa cells exposed to 1 is characterized by a decrease of the G(0)/G(1)-phase and an increase of the S-phase cells, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic rate of HeLa cells treated for 48 h with 210 microg/ml of 1 was 35.8\%. Further, 1 was found to increase the expression of Bax and to decrease the expression of Bcl-2 proteins, respectively, and to lower the mitochondrial transmembrane potential of HeLa cells. The caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO (at 2 microM) increased the viability of HeLa cells treated with 1. Taken together, our study suggests that ginsenoside Rd (1) significantly inhibits HeLa cell proliferation, and induces cell apoptosis through down-regulating Bcl-2 expression, up-regulating Bax expression, lowering the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and activating the caspase-3 pathway. Thus, 1 could serve as a lead to develop novel chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents against human cervical cancer.},

  abstract = {Trilinolein, isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Sanchi (Panax notoginseng), has been shown to have myocardial protective effects via its antioxidant ability. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the protective effect of trilinolein in the heart remain to be elucidated. Oxidative mechanisms have been implicated in neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We previously reported that ET-1 induces ROS generation via the ET(A) receptor and ROS modulates c-fos gene expression. We have therefore examined whether trilinolein attenuates ROS production and ET-1-induced c-fos gene expression in cardiomyocytes. Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were stimulated with ET-1 (10 nM), and c-fos gene expression was examined. Trilinolein (1 and 10 microM) inhibited ET-1-induced c-fos gene expression in cardiomyocytes. We also examined the effects of trilinolein on ET-1-increased NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide formation. Trilinolein inhibited ET-1-increased NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase in superoxide production by ET-1 was significantly inhibited by trilinolein, diphenyleneiodonium, or N-acetylcysteine. Trilinolein also decreased ET-1- or H2O2-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, and activator protein-1 activation. These data indicate that trilinolein inhibits ET-1-induced ERK phosphorylation, JNK phosphorylation, and c-fos gene expression via attenuating superoxide production in cardiomyocytes.},

Six databases were systematically searched including Cochrane Central, PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and VIP to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We assessed the quality of included studies, extracted valid data, and undertook meta-analysis following the steps of systematic review recommended by the Cochrane group. Results. Ten moderate-to-low quality randomized controlled trials involving 969 patients were included. There was no evidence that SPN alone had better or worse effects than conventional drugs on improving clinical symptoms (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.39) and ECG (RR 1.17, 95\% CI 0.84 to 1.63). However, there was an evidence that SPN combined with western medications was a better treatment option than conventional drugs alone in improving clinical symptoms (RR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.33) and ECG (RR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.45). No serious adverse effects were reported. Conclusion. Compared with conventional treatment, SPN may show the potential of optimizing symptomatic outcomes. As a kind of alternative and complementary medicine, SPN may provide another choice for AP patients and further large-scale high-quality trials are needed to confirm this efficacy. © 2014 Xiaochen Yang et al.}

Three valuable medicinal herbs, namely Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, and Panax notoginseng, have received considerable interest due to their extensive application in clinical therapy, healthcare products, and as foods and food additives world-wide. Panax species are known to contain abundant levels of saponins, also dubbed ginsenosides, which refer to a series of dammarane or oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides. These saponins exhibit modulatory effects to the central nervous system and beneficial effects to patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases, and also have anti-diabetic and anti-tumor properties. To the end of 2012, at least 289 saponins were reported from eleven different Panax species. This comprehensive review describes the advances in the phytochemistry of the genus Panax for the period 1963–2012, based on the 134 cited references. The reported saponins can be classified into protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol, octillol, oleanolic acid, C17 side-chain varied, and miscellaneous subtypes, according to structural differences in sapogenins. The investigational history of Panax is also reviewed, with special attention being paid to the structural features of the six different subtypes, together with their 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic characteristics which are useful for determining their structures and absolute configuration.}

The optimized SPPMP was produced by dry-heating the SPI-SSPS mixture (SPP) at a ratio of 3:5, temperature of 60°C and 75\% relative humidity for 3 days. The formation of SPI-SSPS conjugates was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, FTIR spectroscopy and high performance size exclusion chromatography. The citral (10wt\%) oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by SPPMP exhibited superior physical stability than those stabilized by SPI or SPP during prolonged storage, after thermal treatment or under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. At pH 7.0, all the emulsions studied exhibited monomodal particle size distribution initially, however, only those stabilized by SPPMP remained monomodal distribution for up to 70 days during storage at 25°C. The SPPMP-stabilized emulsion maintained its physical stability to the thermal treatment at 95°C for 30min or under simulated gastric conditions for 2h; while the emulsions stabilized by SPI or SPP exhibited various degrees of instability. The release rate of citral from the emulsion droplets was found inversely related to the stability of emulsion. The emulsion droplets retained approximately 70\% of citral after 2h incubation in simulated gastric fluid, whereas, complete release of citral from the droplets occurred in 4h in simulated intestinal fluid. These results indicate that SPPMP-stabilized emulsions have a good potential as a carrier system for intestinal delivery of hydrophobic compounds such as citral.},

Its seeds as a functional food source have attracted much more attention in recent years, and they are rich in monoterpene glycosides and phenolic compounds. To assess the application value of wild peony seeds, the main chemical composition and content, such as total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total flavanol content (TAC), and α and γ tocopherol content, of the seeds from 12 species and 2 subspecies were systematically explored in the present study. Four different antioxidant assays (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and HRSA), antibacterial, and antifungal assays were also performed using various in vitro biochemical methods. The results showed that the seeds of P. delavayi, P. obovata. subsp. obovata, and P. rockii. subsp. rockii had a high content of TPC, TFC, and TAC, respectively. Twenty-five individual chemical compounds were qualitatively and quantitatively measured by HPLC-MS, with paeoniflorin being the most abundant compound in all samples. P. mairei was grouped individually into a group via hierarchical cluster analysis according to its relatively highest monoterpene glycosides and TPC content. This work has provided a basis for the development and utilization of seeds for the selection of wild peony species of dietary interest.},

Using ethanol as a reaction medium, silybin and phospholipids were resolved into the medium, after the organic solvent was removed under vacuum condition, silybin-phospholipid complex was formed. The new complex's physicochemical properties including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solubility, dissolution, etc., were tested. The concentrations of silybin after oral administration of silybin-phospholipid complex and silybin-N-methylglucamine at different time in rats were determined by RP-HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were computed by software program 3p97. Our data showed that silybin and phospholipids in the silybin-phospholipid complex were combined by non-covalent-bond, not forming a new compound and the solubility of silybin-phospholipid complex in water and in n-octanol was effectively enhanced. We found that mean plasma concentration-time curve of silybin after oral administration of silybin-phospholipid complex and silybin-N-methylglucamine in rats was both in accordance with open single-compartment model with first-order absorption. Pharmacokinetic parameters of silybin in rats were Tmax10 and 5 min; Cmax126.72 and 104.29 ng ml-1; AUC0-∞1020.33 and 235.81 ng ml-1h, respectively. The bioavailability of silybin in rats was increased remarkably after oral administration of silybin-phospholipid complex comparing to silybin-N- methylglucamine. This was mainly due to an impressive improvement of the lipophilic property of silybin-phospholipid complex and improvement of the biological effect of silybin. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The monoamine hypothesis proposes that depression is a result of the depletion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) in addition to the activation of monoamine oxidase in the CNS. The purpose of this study was to determine whether P. notoginseng Saponin (PNS) has an antidepressant activity. We investigated the antidepressant-like activities of Rg1, Rb1, R1, Rd, and Re in mice, using two animal models of depression. In addition, we analyzed the neurochemicals by the chronic unpredictable mild stress test. Our results showed that Rb1, Rd, and Re treatment at 10 mg kg-1significantly reduced the duration of immobility in both the tail suspension and forced swimming tests. Rb1, Rd, and Re increases in 5-HT and NE levels at 10 mg kg-1in both the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Dopamine levels increased in the hippocampus and the striatum. Moreover, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were found increased in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that the antidepressant effects of Rb1, Rd, and Re may be related to the increase in 5-HT and NE in the CNS, and through the alterations in the synthesis or metabolism of dopamine. © 2012 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

Materials and methods Inhibitory activity against NO production in lipopolysaccharide-activated RAW264.7 macrophages was evaluated by Griess reaction. Fifteen polyacetylenes were isolated from the active ethyl acetate extract using activity-guided screening. The structures of all compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and comparison with published data. The compounds were further tested for their inhibitory activity against NO production. Results Seven new polyacetylenes, named atractylodemaynes A-G (1-7), along with eight known ones (8-15) were isolated. Compound 14 was isolated for the first time from the rhizomes of A. macrocephala. The study showed that the tested compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against NO production in a dose-dependent manner. Among them, compounds 10, 11 and 12 had relatively stronger inhibitory effect with IC50 values of 28, 23 and 19 ??M, respectively. Conclusion The results demonstrated that the polyacetylenes might greatly contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of the rhizomes of A. macrocephala. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Notoginsengnosides (NG) isolated from Sanqi could inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation of rat washed platelets. To identify the possible target proteins of NG in platelets, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based comparative proteomics was performed and proteins altered in expressional level after NG treatment were identified by MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Treatment of 200 μg/ml NG caused regulation of the levels of 12 proteins, which play important roles in platelet activation, oxidative stress and cytoskeleton. In the NG-treated platelets, there were increase in the levels of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), thrombospondin 1, tubulin alpha 6 and decrease in the levels of thioredoxin, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, DJ-1 protein, peroxiredoxin 3, thioredoxin-like protein 2, ribonuclease inhibitor, potassium channel subfamily V member 2, myosin regulatory light chain 9 and laminin receptor 1. The change in the levels of these proteins caused by NG treatment might contribute to the inhibitive effect of NG on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, analysis of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level indicated that NG could decrease the ROS level in platelets. The regulation of ROS level might play important role in the effect of NG on platelets. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Analyzing the DTI profiling of the drugs helps to infer drug indications, adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, and drug mode of actions. Therefore, it is of high importance to reliably and fast predict DTI profiling of the drugs on a genome-scale level. Here, we develop the TargetNet server, which can make real-time DTI predictions based only on molecular structures, following the spirit of multi-target SAR methodology. Naïve Bayes models together with various molecular fingerprints were employed to construct prediction models. Ensemble learning from these fingerprints was also provided to improve the prediction ability. When the user submits a molecule, the server will predict the activity of the user's molecule across 623 human proteins by the established high quality SAR model, thus generating a DTI profiling that can be used as a feature vector of chemicals for wide applications. The 623 SAR models related to 623 human proteins were strictly evaluated and validated by several model validation strategies, resulting in the AUC scores of 75-100~\%. We applied the generated DTI profiling to successfully predict potential targets, toxicity classification, drug-drug interactions, and drug mode of action, which sufficiently demonstrated the wide application value of the potential DTI profiling. The TargetNet webserver is designed based on the Django framework in Python, and is freely accessible at http://targetnet.scbdd.com .},

Whipping properties of the soybean products, expressed by foam expansion and foam stability, were found to correlate with water dispersible nitrogen, and the resultant foams were stable when the dissolved proteins were native. Thus, the native defatted soybean flour which contained native and soluble protein exhibited excellent whipping property. Emulsifying properties correlated positively with protein and negatively with fiber contents. As soybean protein isolate and soybean protein extract are rich in protein and poor in fiber contents, both of them show good emulsifying functions.},

  abstract = {Objective: To explore the roles of persistent systemic inflammation in atherosclerosis and the effects of saponins of Panax Notoginseng (PNS) on this process in rabbits. Methods: Thirty rabbits were divided randomly and equally into 6 groups, i.e., control, high-fat diet, inflammation, aspirin, PNS and simple-inflammation group. All the animals except that in control group and simple-inflammation group were fed with high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Based on that, rabbits in inflammation, aspirin and PNS groups were treated with zymosan injection (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Normal saline was given to rabbits in control group. Besides zymosan injection, animals in aspirin and PNS group were administrated with aspirin (12 mg/kg, i.g.) and PNS (120 mg/kg, i.g.) respectively. The animals in simple-inflammation group were treated with zymosan injection (10mg/kg, i.p.) and fed with normal diet. The atherosclerosis lesion in aortas was observed by Sudan IV staining. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), TNF-α and activity of post-heparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were measured at the end of the 4th and 8th week after an overnight fast. Results: Compared with high-fat diet group, the area of atherosclerosis lesion, serum TG and TNF-αwere markedly increased in rabbits of inflammation group, and the activity of LPL was decreased remarkably. Serum TNF-α level was negatively correlated with the activity of post-heparin LPL (r = -0.708, P {$<$} 0.01). The area of atherosclerosis, serum TG and TNF-αwere decreased in aspirin and PNS group compared with that in inflammation group, and the activity of LPL was increased remarkably. Compared with control group, serum TG and TNF-α were markedly increased in simple-inflammation group, while LPL activity was decreased. Atherosclerotic lesion did not occur in simple-inflammation group. Conclusions: Persistent systemic inflammation could accelerate the formation of atherosclerosis lesion in aortas, which partly depend on the decreasing of the activity of post-heparin lipoprotein lipase. PNS could improve the changes caused by inflammation. © 2008 The Editorial Board of Journal of Medical Colleges of PLA.},

  abstract = {Herbs have been long known to provide health-promoting benefits and are demonstrated to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, analgesic, and antitumor activities. This study evaluated the effects of drying conditions and extraction protocols on the biochemical activity of three culinary and medicinal herbs: rosemary (               Rosmarinus officinalis               ), motherwort (               Leonurus cardiaca               ), and peppermint (               Mentha piperita               ). Leaf tissues were dried by sun, oven-dried at 40 °C, or oven-dried at 70 °C and extracted using 80\% methanol or 80\% ethanol. Total polyphenol (TPP) using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method and antioxidant capacity using the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay were determined. Both drying and extraction conditions significantly impacted TPP content and TEAC in the three herb species. Sun-dried or 40 °C oven-dried herbs exhibited significantly higher TPP content and TEAC capacity than fresh samples, suggesting low-temperature drying may be a good postharvest means to store medicinal/culinary herbs. Exposure to 70 °C oven-drying caused significant antioxidant loss. In addition, the current study showed that with fresh tissue, 80\% ethanol extraction had significantly higher TPP and TEAC than 80\% methanol extraction for all three herbs, yet for dried herbs, the efficacy of ethanol/methanol extraction varied with different drying treatments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Citrus grandis 'Tomentosa', as the fruit epicarp of C. grandis 'Tomentosa' or C. grandis (L.) Osbeck, is widely used in health food and medicine. Actually, based on our survey results, there are also rich essential oils with bioativities in leaves, but the chemical compounds in this part and relevant pharmacological activities have never been studied systematically yet. Therefore, this study was to preliminarily decipher the pharmacological activities and mechanisms of the essential oil in leaves of C. grandis 'Tomentosa' by an integrated network pharmacology approach. METHODS: Essential oil compositions from leaves of C. grandis 'Tomentosa' were identified using GC-MS/MS. And then the targets of these oil compositions were predicted and screened from TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction, STITCH and SEA databases. STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction networks, and the eligible protein targets were input into WebGestalt 2019 to carry out GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Based on the potential targets, disease enrichment information was obtained by TTD databases. Cytoscape software was used to construct the component-target-disease network diagrams. RESULTS: Finally, 61 essential oil chemical components were identified by GC-MS/MS, which correspond to 679 potential targets. Biological function analysis showed that there were 12, 19, and 12 GO entries related to biological processes, cell components and molecular functions, respectively. 43 KEGG pathways were identified, of which the most significant categories were terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, TNF signaling pathway and leishmaniasis. The component-target-disease network diagram revealed that the essential oil compositions in leaves of C. grandis 'Tomentosa' could treat tumors, immune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and respiratory diseases, which were highly related to CHRM1, PTGS2, CASP3, MAP2K1 and CDC25B. CONCLUSION: This study may provide a new insight into C. grandis 'Tomentosa' or C. grandis (L.) Osbeck and may provide useful information for future utilization and development.},

Therefore, many cosmetic brands are encouraged to offer more natural products to the market, such as plant extracts that can be used for their antiaging, antiwrinkle, and depigmentation properties and other cosmetic purposes. In the current study, the volatile constituents of the hexane-soluble fraction of a Stenocarpus sinuatus (family Proteaceae) leaf methanol extract (SSHF) were analyzed using GC/MS analysis. Moreover, the antiaging activity of SSHF was evaluated through in vitro studies of anti-collagenase, anti-elastase, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-hyaluronidase activities. In addition, an in silico docking study was carried out to identify the interaction mechanisms of the major compounds in SSHF with the active sites of the target enzymes. Furthermore, an in silico toxicity study of the identified compounds in SSHF was performed. It was revealed that vitamin E (α-tocopherol) was the major constituent of SSHF, representing 52.59\% of the extract, followed by γ-sitosterol (8.65\%), neophytadiene (8.19\%), β-tocopherol (6.07\%), and others. The in vitro studies showed a significant inhibition by SSHF of collagenase, elastase, tyrosinase, and hyaluronidase, with IC50 values of 60.03, 177.5, 67.5, and 38.8 µg/mL, respectively, comparable to those of the positive controls epigallocatechin gallate (ECGC, for collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase) and kojic acid (for tyrosinase). Additionally, the molecular docking study revealed good acceptable binding scores of the four major compounds, comparable to those of ECGC and kojic acid. Besides, the SSHF identified phytoconstituents showed no predicted potential toxicity nor skin toxicity, as determined in silico. In conclusion, the antiaging potential of SSHF may be attributed to its high content of vitamin E in addition to the synergetic effect of other volatile constituents. Thus, SSHF could be incorporated in pharmaceutical skin care products and cosmetics after further studies.},

It has been demonstrated that PNS have extensive effects on the cardiovascular system, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, increasing blood flow, improving left ventricular diastolic function in hypertensive patients and anti-inflammatory effect. Aim of study: Recent researches indicated that PNS administration inhibited foam cells' formation. The present study was designed to study the effects of PNS on atherogenesis and to explore the relevant molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: The Zymosan A induced atherosclerosis models were used to investigate the anti-atherosclerosis effects of PNS. The integrin express array was used to check the changes of integrins. The foam cell formation was observed with transmission electron microscope. The effect of PNS on phosphorylation of FAK on threonine 397 and protein level of NF-κB was also evaluated in vitro. Results: PNS treated rats had less plaque spots on the aortas compared with Zym induced group. The formation of foam cell was inhibited by PNS. Compared with Zym treated group, the expression of most integrin families decreased except Itgav and Itgb2 after PNS treatment. PNS inhibited phosphorylation of FAK on threonine 397 and translocation of NF-κB. Conclusion: High fat diet together with Zym induces atherogenesis of rat. PNS inhibits zymosan A induced atherogenesis by suppressing FAK phosphorylation, integrins expression and NF-κB translocation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Timosaponin B-II (TB-II), a major steroidal saponin constituent in Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, exhibits various activities, including anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic functions. However, the anti-DN effects and potential mechanism(s) of TB-II have not been previously reported. Purpose: To investigate the effect of TB-II on DN in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Methods: TB-II was isolated and purified from A. asphodeloides Bunge using macroporous adsorption resin and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of TB-II on DN was evaluated in alloxan-induced diabetic mice using an assay kit and immunohistochemical determination in vivo. The expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways was also measured using Western blot analysis. Results: TB-II significantly decreased the blood glucose levels and ameliorated renal histopathological injury in  alloxan-induced diabetic mice. In addition, TB-II remarkably decreased the levels of renal function biochemical factors, such as kidney index, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urinary uric acid, urine creatinine, and urine protein, and it reduced lipid metabolism levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides and the levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in alloxan-induced mice. Furthermore, TB-II inhibited the expression of mTOR, TXNIP, and NF-κB. Conclusion: The results revealed that TB-II plays an important role in DN via TXNIP, mTOR, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Overall, TB-II exhibited a prominently ameliorative effect on alloxan-induced DN.},

  abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Salvia miltiorrhiza and Panax notoginseng are popularly used traditional Chinese medicine for cardiovascular disorders and they are often used in the form of combination. However, mechanisms of their cardioprotective effects were still not clear. In the present study, the protective effects of salvianolic acids (SA), notoginsengnosides (NG) and combination of SA and NG (CSN) against rat cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury were checked and the protein expression profiles of heart tissues were examined to search their possible protein targets. Materials and methods: The cardioprotective effects of SA, NG and CSN were checked in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) by temporarily occluding coronary artery for 20 min followed by reperfusion. Rats were grouped into sham-operation group, IR group, IR + SA group, IR + NG group and IR + CSN group. The plasma creatine kinase (CK) activities were measured using commercial kit and the percentages of infarcted area in total ventricle tissue were calculated after nitroblue-tetrazolium (N-BT) staining of heart tissue slices. Two-dimensional protein electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to check the protein expression profiles of heart tissues. Then, proteins differentially expressed between IR group and sham-operation group were identified using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS). The regulative effects of SA, NG and CSN on these IR-related proteins were analyzed. Results: Treatments including SA, NG and CSN all showed cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury and CSN exhibited to be the best. Eighteen proteins involved in IR injury were found. These proteins are involved in pathways including energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, muscle contraction, heat shock stress, cell survival and proliferation. The regulation of these proteins by SA, NG or CSN suggested possible protein targets in their cardioprotective effects. Conclusions: SA and NG showed both similarity and difference in their protein targets involved in cardioprotective effects. The capability of CSN to regulate both protein targets of SA and NG might be the basis of CSN to show cardioprotective effects better than that of SA or NG. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract = {Intestinal immune system modulating arabino-3,6-galactan (ALR-5IIa-1-1) has been purified from rhizomes of Atractylodes lancea DC. In order to characterize the structure of ALR-5IIa-1-1 sequential enzymic digestion using exo-??-L-arabinofuranosidase and exo-??-D-(1 ??? 3)-galactanase was employed. After ALR-5IIa-1-1 was digested with the arabinofuranosidase to give AF-ALR-5IIa-1-1, the galactanase digestion cleaved only 10\% and 23\% of 3-linked and 3,6-branched Gal in AF-ALR-5Iia-1-1, respectively, and gave small amounts of intermediate size (AF-GN-2) and shorter oligosaccharide (AF-GN-3) fractions in addition to a large amount of the galactanase-resistant fraction (AF-GN-1). When AF-GN-1 was re-digested gradually with the arabinofuranosidase and galactanase, it released trace amounts of oligosaccharides in addition to a large amount of the enzyme-resistant fraction. When the final enzyme-resistant fraction from AF-GN-1 was digested simultaneously with both arabinofuranosidase and galactanase, the resistant fraction was significantly degraded into two long fragments (AF                         3-GN                         3-1 and 2). Mixture of digestion products from the first galactanase digestion of AF-ALR-5IIa-1-1 showed decreased intestinal immune system modulating activity which was correspond to about 30\% of the activity of ALR-5IIa-1-1, but the galactanase resistant fraction (AF-GN-1) still had significant activity. Although the second gradual enzymic digestion of AF-GN-1 caused little decrease in activity, the resulting fragments (AF                         3-GN                         3-1 and 2) from the final enzymic digestion lost most of the activity. Component sugar, methylation and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses indicated that the oligosaccharides released from AF-ALR-5IIa-1-1 by the first galactanase digestion consisted of galactosyl di- to hexadecasaccharides mainly comprising 6-linked Galp and Galf some of which were partially mono- or diarabinosylated. These oligosaccharides were attached to the non-reducing terminal side of ??-d-(1 ??? 3)-galactan backbone as side chains. The final fragments (AF                         3-GN                         3-1 and 2) were located in the inner core of ALR-5IIa-1-1, and AF                         3-GN                         3-2 was composed mainly of terminal, 3-linked and 6-linked Gal whereas AF                         3-GN                         3-1 was suggested to have a complex structure. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Enrolled subjects (n=104) were aged 71.2±9.9 years and had a mini-mental state examination score of 26.0±2.0 (mean ± standard deviation). They underwent the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) test and the clock drawing test at baseline and upon completion of a 60-day period of dietary supplementation with one tablet daily of the tested compound. In 102 assessable subjects, total ADAS-cog scores improved from 13.7±5.8 at baseline to 9.7±4.9 on day 60, and the clock drawing test scores improved from 8.5±2.3 to 9.1±1.9. Both changes were statistically significant (P{$<$}0.001). Memory tasks were the individual components of ADAS-cog showing the largest improvements. In a multivariate analysis, larger improvements in total ADAS-cog score were associated with less compromised baseline mini-mental state examination scores. Perceived efficacy was rated as excellent or good by 62\% of study subjects. The tested compound was well tolerated; one nonserious adverse event was reported in the overall study population, and perceived tolerability was rated excellent or good by 99\% of the subjects. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with the tested compound shows potential for counteracting cognitive impairment in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and warrants further investigation in adequately controlled, longer-term studies.},

However, the constituents responsible for its antiallergic effects remain unidentified. In the present study, a novel bisepoxylignan, isoeudesmin (1), and eight known bisepoxylignans, pluviatilol (2), eudesmin (3), magnolin (4), lirioresinol-B dimethyl ether (5), epimagnolin B (6), kobusin (7), aschantin (8), fargesin (9), were isolated from effective fractions through antiallergic bioassay-guided procedures using mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and IgE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis mice. The compound structures were elucidated through nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry analyses. Compound 1 and compounds 2-6 and 9 exhibited antiallergic effects without affecting the viability of BMMCs. Compounds 2 and 9 showed the strongest effects with IC 50 values of 52.18 and 93.03 μM, respectively. In this paper, the structure-activity relationship between thes e bisepoxylignans and their antiallergic effects is discussed. After evaluating the intensity of the antiallergic effects of the extracts, further separating the fractions, and isolating the purified compounds, we concluded that biosepoxylignans are the main constituents in Xin-Yi contributing to its anti-allergic efficacy.}

  abstract = {We have previously reported that notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1) increases the synthesis of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity in cultured human endothelial cells from different vascular sources. It was the aim of this study to investigate whether the effect of NG-R1 on the synthesis of components of the fibrinolytic system is also operative in another cell type of the blood vessel wall, the smooth muscle cell. Therefore cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) were treated with NG-R1. When the HPASMCs (passage 4 or 5) were conditioned with NG-R1, a dose (0.01-100 micrograms NG-R1/ml for 24 hrs.) dependent increase in t-PA an u-PA synthesis was observed, which was significant from 1 microgram NG-R1/ml on. t-PA antigen increased from 2.4 +/- 0.1 to 4.7 +/- 0.5 ng/10(5) cells/24 hrs.; u-PA antigen increased from 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.0 +/- 0.4 ng/10(5) cells/24 hrs. In contrast no change in PAI-1 antigen synthesis was seen in the conditioned media from NG-R1 treated HPASMCs. On Northern blot analysis of mRNA obtained from NG-R1-stimulated and control HPASMCs NG-R1 induced a significant increases in mRNA levels of t-PA and u-PA (180\% and 200\% of control value, respectively) at 100 micrograms NG-R1/ml while PAI-1 mRNA decreased slightly. In conclusion our data give evidence that NG-R1 can increase the fibrinolytic potential in cultured HPASMCs in vitro by increasing the production of t-PA and u-PA. If operative in vivo this effect of NG-R1 on the fibrinolytic system of SMCs might also contribute to the effect of the Chinese herb drug Panax notoginseng in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.}

Wistar rats were exposed to a 95°C water bath for 10s to produce 30\% TBSA skin-full-thickness scalds. Myocardial Gsα mRNA level, cAMP content and adenyl cyclase (AC) activities were determined with dot blotting hybridization, radioimmunoassay and indirect method, respectively. The ATPase activities in plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes and erythrocytes were measured colorimetrically. At 3, 6, 9 hours after scalds, the myocardial Gsα mRNA expression decreased significantly (P{$<$}0.01). PNS (100, 200mgkg-1, i.p.) markedly increased these levels (P{$<$}0.01). The elevation was correlated significantly with PNS dose (r=0.95, P{$<$}0.05). At 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 hour after the scalds, the myocardial cAMP content and AC basal activity was reduced significantly. PNS (100, 200mgkg-1, i.p.) increased cAMP content and enhanced AC activity markedly in comparison with the 3rd hour postburn group. The activities of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase and (Na+-K+)-ATPase in plasma membrane of myocardial cells and red blood cells in scald group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group (P{$<$}0.01). PNS (100mgkg-1, i.p.) improved these indexes significantly after scalds (P{$<$}0.01 or 0.05). These data suggested that the effects of PNS on myocardium in burned rats involved its action to increase myocardial Gsα mRNA expression and AC activity, cAMP content as well as ATPase activities. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

This review summarizes the functions, structures of fungal CYP51 proteins, and the inhibitors targeting these homologs. In particular, several drug-resistant mechanisms associated with the fungal CYP51s are introduced. The sequences and crystal structures of CYP51 proteins in different fungal species are also compared. These will provide new insights for the advancement of research on antifungal agents.},

Our two recent clinical trials showed that ginsenoside Rd (Rd), a kind of monomeric compound extracted from Chinese herbs, Panax ginseng and Panax notoginseng, was safe and efficacious for the treatment of ischemic stroke. In this study, we conducted a pooled analysis of the data from 199 patients with acute ischemic stroke in the first trial and 390 in the second to reanalyze the efficacy and safety of Rd. Moreover, animal stroke models were carried out to explore the possible molecular mechanisms underlying Rd neuroprotection. The pooled analysis showed that compared with placebo group, Rd could improve patients' disability as assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on day 90 post-stroke and reduce neurologic deficits on day 15 or day 90 post-stroke as assessed by NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and Barthel Index (BI) scores. For neuroprotective mechanisms, administration of Rd 4 h after stroke could inhibit ischemia-induced microglial activation, decrease the expression levels of various proinflammatory cytokines, and suppress nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells inhibitor, alpha (IkappaBalpha) phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation. An in vitro proteasome activity assay revealed a significant inhibitory effect of Rd on proteasome activity in microglia. Interestingly, Rd was showed to have less side effects than glucocorticoid. Therefore, our study demonstrated that Rd could safely improve the outcome of patients with ischemic stroke, and this therapeutic effect may result from its capability of suppressing microglial proteasome activity and sequential inflammation.},

  abstract = {The scientific understanding of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been hindered by the lack of methods that can explore the complex nature and combinatorial rules of herbal formulae. On the assumption that herbal ingredients mainly target a molecular network to adjust the imbalance of human body, here we present a-self-developed TCM network pharmacology platform for discovering herbal formulae in a systematic manner. This platform integrates a set of network-based methods that we established previously to catch the network regulation mechanism and to identify active ingredients as well as synergistic combinations for a given herbal formula. We then provided a case study on an antirheumatoid arthritis (RA) formula, Qing-Luo-Yin (QLY), to demonstrate the usability of the platform. We revealed the target network of QLY against RA-related key processes including angiogenesis, inflammatory response, and immune response, based on which we not only predicted active and synergistic ingredients from QLY but also interpreted the combinatorial rule of this formula. These findings are either verified by the literature evidence or have the potential to guide further experiments. Therefore, such a network pharmacology strategy and platform is expected to make the systematical study of herbal formulae achievable and to make the TCM drug discovery predictable.}

(MO) and its root have long been used in traditional medicines in China and northeast Asia as tonics for nourishing the kidney, strengthening the bone and enhancing immunofunction in the treatment of impotence, osteoporosis, depression and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and dermatitis. Aim of the review This review aims to sum up updated and comprehensive information about traditional usage, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of MO and provide insights into potential opportunities for future research and development of this plant. Methods A bibliographic investigation was performed by analyzing the information available on MO in the internationally accepted scientific databases including Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Yahoo, Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations in Chinese. Information was also obtained from some local and foreign books on ethnobotany and ethnomedicines. Results The literature supported the ethnomedicinal uses of MO as recorded in China for various purposes. The ethnomedical uses of MO have been recorded in many regions of China. More than 100 chemical compounds have been isolated from this plant, and the major constituents have been found to be polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, anthraquinones and iridoid glycosides. Crude extracts and pure compounds of this plant are used as effective agents in the treatment of depression, osteoporosis, fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, and infertility due to their anti-depressant, anti-osteoporosis, pro-fertility, anti-radiation, anti-Alzheimer disease, anti-rheumatoid, anti-fatigue, anti-aging, cardiovascularprotective, anti-oxidation, immune-regulatory, and anti-inflammatory activities. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that the main components of MO including monotropein and deacetyl asperulosidic acid are distributed in various organs and tissues. The investigation on acute toxicity and genotoxicity indicated that MO is nontoxic. There have no reports on significant adverse effect at a normal dose in clinical application, but MO at dose of more than 1000 mg/kg may cause irritability, insomnia and unpleasant sensations in individual cases. Conclusion MO has emerged as a good source of traditional medicines. Some uses of this plant in traditional medicines have been validated by pharmacological investigations. However, the molecular mechanism, structure-activity relationship, and potential synergistic and antagonistic effects of its multi-components such as polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, anthraquinones and iridoid glycosides need to be further elucidated, and the structural feature of polysaccharides also need to be further clarified. Sophisticated analytical technologies should be developed to comprehensively evaluate the quality of MO based on HPLC-fingerprint and content determination of the active constituents, knowing that these investigations will help further utilize this plant.},

The effects of aqueous ethanol concentration and the mixure ratio (hexane to ethanol) on the degree of protein denaturation and product quality were investigated, on the basis of which the orthogonal tests were performed. The optimum technical parameters were obtained by analyzing the results of the orthogonal tests with statistical methods. We found that SPC can be obtained by extracting full-fat soy flour under the following conditions: mixture ratio hexane: 90\% ethanol, 9:1, v/v; extraction temperature, 45(degrees)C; ratio of solid to solvents, (1:2 w/v); and 5 repeated extractions (15 min each time).

  abstract = {Previous studies have reported on the anti-atherosclerotic effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-atherosclerotic effects of PNS and the inflammatory response. Thirty rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely a control group, a group, in which zymosan A was used to induce inflammation (Zym group) and a PNS-treated group. Rats in the three groups were administered liquid paraffin (i.p.), zymosan A (20 mg/kg, i.p., once every 3 days) or zymosan A and PNS (100 mg/kg, i.p., once daily), respectively. All animals were fed a high-fat diet for 9 weeks. At scheduled times, rats were killed, blood was collected and the aorta was removed. Pathological changes in aortas were observed using Sudan IV staining and transmission electron microscopy. Serum lipids were measured enzymatically. Whole-blood viscosity was observed at different shear rates. The expression of cardiovascular disease-specific genes was determined using GEArray (SuperArray, Frederick, MA, USA). Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression levels of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB/p65 and its inhibitor IkappaBalpha in the aortic wall. In the present study, typical pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis in rats following induction by zymosan A were alleviated by PNS treatment. In the PNS-treated group, there was a marked reduction in total serum cholesterol, triglycerides and blood viscosity. In addition, PNS treatment significantly decreased the gene expression of some inflammatory factors, such as integrins, interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1beta and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. The expression of NF-kappaB/p65 was attenuated, whereas the expression of IkappaBalpha was significantly increased, after treatment with PNS. In conclusion, it appears that PNS exerts its therapeutic effects on atherosclerosis through an anti-inflammatory action and regulation of the blood lipid profile and that an NF-kappaB signalling pathway is involved.},

  abstract = {Six new triterpenoids, euscaphic acids G-L (1-6), along with nine known triterpene acids, and two known lignans were isolated from the ethanolic extract of the twigs of Euscaphis japonica. This is the first report concerning 1α,3β-dihydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid isolated from a natural source. The structures of the new compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis. The cytotoxic and anti-NO production activities for the isolates are also evaluated and discussed; compound 1, hederagenin (11), and arjunic acid (12) showed significant cytotoxicity against NCI-H460 cells, HT-29 cells, and CEM cells (IC50 = 1.64 ± 0.87, 2.11 ± 1.54, 1.73 ± 0.64 µM, respectively). Some of the isolated triterpenoids showed marginal inhibitions on NO production induced by LPS.},

A high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method was developed for the preparative separation and purification of two main bioactive components, namely, atractylon and atractylenolide III from A. macrocephala by using light petroleum (60-90 degrees C)-ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (4:1:4:1 v/v) as the two-phase solvent system in dual-mode elution. Compared with the separation using the normal-mode elution, the dual-mode HSCCC can be achieved with shorter elution time. Atractylenolide III (32.1 mg) at 99.0\% purity and 319.6 mg atractylon at 97.8\% purity could be obtained from 1000 mg crude sample in a single run. The recoveries of atractylenolide III and atractylon were 95.4 and 92.6\%, respectively.},

The present study investigated whether administration of ICA + PNS had preventive and therapeutic effects on bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly as follows: sham-operated, i.g. vehicle, ICA (5 mg/kg), PNS (40 mg/kg), ICA + PNS (2.5 + 20, 5 + 40 or 10 + 80 mg/kg), and ergoloid mesylate as a positive control (0.45 mg/kg) in model rats. Treatment was performed once a day for 7 days prior to ischemia. The rats were subjected to transient global IR induced by CCA occlusion in combination with intraperitoneal injection of sodium nitroprusside (2.0 mg/kg), then treated with ICA + PNS for another 14 days continuously. ICA + PNS significantly improved the rat passive avoidance task in step-down paradigms, and spatial cognition in the eight-arm radial maze, concomitant with an improvement of blood viscosity. Increased lipid peroxidation in brain after IR injury was observed, MDA being 0.56 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg prot vs 0.48 +/- 0.06 nmol/mg prot in the vehicle control (p {$<$} 0.05). Treatment with ICA + PNS 2.5 + 10, 5 + 40, 10 + 80 mg/kg produced a marked reduction in the MDA level to 0.46 +/- 0.06, 0.42 +/- 0.09 and 0.45 +/- 0.08 nmol/mg prot, respectively vs 0.56 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg prot in IR injury only control (p {$<$} 0.05, p {$<$} 0.01). A decrease in superoxide dismutase activity was observed in the brain of IR rats (the SOD activity being 72.75 +/- 4.62 U/mg prot vs 80.97 +/- 6.06 U/mg prot in control, p {$<$} 0.05). ICA + PNS 5 + 40 mg/kg prevented the IR injury mediated fall in superoxide dismutase activity being 78.90 +/- 6.61 U/mg prot versus 72.75 +/- 4.62 U/mg prot (p {$<$} 0.05). ICA + PNS tended to attenuate apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Either ICA or PNS treatment alone did not obviously improve cognitive impairment (except that lipid peroxidation was reduced by PNS-treatment). The results indicated that ICA + PNS may ameliorate learning and memory deficit and blood viscosity by protecting neurons from oxidative stress in ischemic brain.},

  abstract = {Oleum Cinnamomi is a traditional medicine used by the Hmong, the essential oil obtained from Fructus Cinnamomi, for the treatment of coronary heart disease. Information regarding the efficient quality control markers of it is lacking, which has become a bottleneck restricting its development and utilization. Here, an integrated qualitative analysis approach based on a GC-MS and network pharmacology strategy was applied to explore quality control markers for the assessment of Oleum Cinnamomi. Firstly, the compounds of Oleum Cinnamomi were detected by GC-MS. In total, 57 chemical components were identified, mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, accounting for 83.05\% of total essential oil components. Secondly, network pharmacology was adopted to explore the compounds linked to target genes of coronary heart disease. Fifty-two compounds were found, indicating the effectiveness of Oleum Cinnamomi in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Among them, 10 compounds, including eucalyptol, were chosen as potential effective compounds in Oleum Cinnamomi. Thirdly, an established GC-MS SIM method was validated and applied for the simultaneous determination of the contents of these 10 compounds using 20 sample batches of Oleum Cinnamomi. It was preliminarily found that the contents of these 10 compounds differed in Oleum Cinnamomi from different origins. Finally, quantitative analyte data were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis to determine Oleum Cinnamomi quality. Four compounds (eucalyptol, p-cymene, sabinene, β-pinene) were identified as chemical markers for quality control. Accordingly, this study provides new strategies to explore the quality control markers and develops a novel method for the quality assessment of Oleum Cinnamomi.},

Rutin is found in many plants and is also an important dietary constituent of food and plant-based beverages. Rutin has several pharmacological properties including antioxidant and cardioprotective activities. Also, it was identified that rutin is the major low-density lipoprotein (LDL) antioxidant compound of mulberry in an in vitro study. The effects of rutin were tested by using it as a supplement in a high-cholesterol diet. Male rats were fed a high-cholesterol diet (1 ml/100 g) for 4 weeks with rutin (10 or 100 mg/kg) or rutin 100 mg/kg and lovastatin supplementation to study the hypocholesterolaemic effects of rutin on plasma lipid levels, hepatic enzyme activity, and liver tissue. Feeding the animals a high-cholesterol diet resulted in marked hypercholesterolaemia and increased the serum level of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Rutin (at 100 mg/kg) alone or in combination with lovastatin significantly reduced the levels of total cholesterol, and LDL-C and also markedly decreased liver enzymes and weight in animals with a high-cholesterol diet. Our findings show that 100 mg/kg of rutin alone or with lovastatin supplementation lowered liver weight and enzymes as well as plasma total cholesterol and LDL. The hepatic histopathological results reflect the correlation of rutin and lovastatin combination with both liver weight and the levels of plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C. These results indicate that rutin in combination with lovastatin has increased anti-hypercholesterolaemic effects in an animal model. © 2009 Nordic Pharmacological Society.}
